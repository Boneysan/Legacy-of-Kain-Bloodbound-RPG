# Chapter 6: Skill Checks and Abilities
In the shadowed ruins of Nosgoth, every action carries weight—whether weaving through a vampire’s claws, inscribing forbidden glyphs, or swaying a crowd with honeyed words. The skill check system governs how characters attempt tasks, face challenges, and shape the narrative through their choices. This chapter details how to resolve actions using the D6 dice pool system, how skills define a character’s capabilities, and how success or failure can alter the course of your journey in the Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG.
## Skill Check Mechanics
Skill checks are the heart of resolving actions in Nosgoth. Whether you’re leaping across crumbling spires, countering a Hylden’s arcane trap, or convincing a Sarafan lord to spare your life, a skill check determines your success.
### How to Roll a Skill Check
To attempt a skill check:

Identify the Task: The Game Master (GM) determines the relevant Attribute and Skill for the action.
Form the Dice Pool: Add the character’s Attribute score to their Skill level to determine the number of six-sided dice (D6s) to roll.
Roll and Count Successes: Roll the dice pool. Each 5 or 6 counts as one success.
Compare to Difficulty: The number of successes must meet or exceed the task’s Difficulty Rating (DR) to succeed.

Players may enhance their rolls by pushing (see below) or leveraging narrative advantages, subject to GM approval.
## Difficulty Ratings (DR)
Every task is assigned a Difficulty Rating, reflecting the number of successes needed for a standard success. The table below outlines typical difficulties and example tasks:



DR
Difficulty
Successes Needed
Example Task



0
Trivial
0
Opening an unlocked door, walking across clear ground


1
Simple
1
Hiding in dim light, jumping a small gap, basic first aid


2
Standard
2
Picking a common lock, deceiving a naive guard, standard attack


3
Challenging
3
Disarming a complex spectral trap, resisting a potent glyph


4
Difficult
4
Casting under extreme pressure, navigating cursed fog


5+
Extreme/Legendary
5+
Possessing a powerful boss, breaking chains of prophecy


## Pushing a Roll
If a skill check fails, a player may choose to push the roll for another chance at success, at great risk:

Reroll Non-Successes: Reroll all dice that did not result in a 5 or 6.
Add Corruption Die (CD): Include one additional D6, called a Corruption Die, in the reroll.
Corruption Risk: For each 1 rolled on a Corruption Die, the character’s Corruption score increases by 1. If the Corruption score was 3 or higher before the roll, and a 1 is rolled on the CD, the character must immediately roll 2d6 on the Corruption Dice Failure Table (see Chapter 5: Corruption and Consequences).
Narrative Impact: Pushing reflects desperation or tapping into forbidden power, adding tension and risk to the story.

## Opposed Rolls
When two characters directly compete (e.g., a vampire sneaking past a guard’s watchful eyes), use an opposed roll:

Both characters roll their relevant dice pools (Attribute + Skill).
The character with the most 6s wins.
If tied, the GM determines the outcome, which may result in a standoff, stalemate, or unexpected consequence.

## Degrees of Success
The number of successes rolled determines not only whether you succeed but how impressively you do so:



Successes
Outcome



0
Failure: The task fails, potentially with consequences. The GM may allow a retry.


1
Standard Success: You accomplish the task as intended.


2
Strong Success: Gain a bonus, such as extra information or faster completion.


3+
Critical Success: Choose a bonus effect or narrate a dramatic outcome, subject to GM approval.


## Bonus Effects for Extra Successes
Extra successes beyond the DR enhance the outcome, allowing for tactical or narrative advantages. Below are sample effects:



Extra Successes
Sample Effects



+1
Deal +1 damage, reduce target’s armor by 1, perform the task silently


+2
Inflict a status effect (e.g., Staggered, Prone), gain advantageous positioning


+3
Gain an extra action next round, cause a chain reaction, reveal a hidden secret


+4+
Perform a cinematic stunt, permanently alter the scene, bypass an entire challenge


Stunts for Exceptional Success
With 4 or more successes, characters can perform stunts—dramatic, cinematic actions that reshape the scene. These are subject to GM approval and should fit the narrative. Examples include:

Combat Stunts:

Leap from a ledge to impale an enemy mid-air.
Deflect a spell back at its caster or onto a reflective surface.
Disarm two enemies with a single sweeping motion.
Deliver a final blow while grabbing a falling relic.
Cause an enemy to fall off a cliff or through a crumbling floor.
Catch and throw an incoming projectile back at the attacker.
Pull an ally out of harm’s way while striking.
Use the environment (e.g., chandelier, chain, pillar) in an attack.


Social Stunts:

Convince a hostile NPC to become neutral or allied.
Expose a hidden trait or weakness during an argument.
Turn a crowd in your favor during a speech or debate.
Secure a major favor or commitment without cost.
Uncover a buried secret mid-conversation.


Stealth Stunts:

Infiltrate a restricted area without leaving a trace.
Plant or retrieve an object without detection.
Eavesdrop unnoticed and gain leverage.
Knock out a guard and hide them mid-patrol.
Create a perfect alibi for your location.



These stunts empower players to weave Nosgoth’s dark tapestry with creativity and flair, making every roll a chance for heroism or tragedy.
The Skill System
Skills define a character’s expertise and shape their role in Nosgoth’s unforgiving world. From wielding cursed blades to deciphering ancient prophecies, skills provide mechanical depth and narrative flavor. Each skill is tied to one or two Attributes, chosen by the GM based on the action’s context.
Skill Mechanics

Dice Pool: Roll a number of D6s equal to Attribute + Skill level.
Successes: Each 5 or 6 counts as one success. Most tasks require 1–2 successes, with higher DRs for complex challenges.
Skill Cap: Characters can have up to 5 ranks in any skill, but only 3 ranks at character creation (level 1).
Pushing Rolls: As described above, players may push rolls by adding a Corruption Die, risking Corruption for a second chance.

Core Skill Descriptions
Skills are grouped into five categories: Combat, Arcane & Forbidden, Stealth & Subterfuge, Social & Mental, and Lore & Practical. Below is a detailed breakdown of each skill and its applications.
Combat Skills

Weapon Mastery (Fury or Shadow): Expertise with weapons, from forged steel to supernatural claws. Governs accuracy, special strikes, disarming maneuvers, and tactical placement in melee or ranged combat. High ranks enable dual-wielding or exploiting enemy weaknesses. Use to identify exotic weapons or understand battlefield hierarchies.
Evasion (Shadow or Will): The ability to dodge, roll, or sidestep attacks and hazards. Essential for avoiding lethal blows, traps, or glyph-triggered blasts. High ranks grant supernatural reflexes, negating even magical threats.
Unarmed Combat (Blood or Fury): Fighting without weapons, using fists, claws, grapples, or fangs. Governs grapples, throws, disarms, and limb breaks. Vital for feral vampires or Wraiths, allowing them to challenge armed foes.
Tactics (Will or Focus): Battlefield awareness and strategic planning. Predict enemy movements, call out flanks, or direct allies. Grants bonuses to allies, reveals vulnerabilities, or allows repositioning without attacks of opportunity. Ideal for leaders like Blood Knights or Sarafan.

Arcane & Forbidden

Glyphcasting (Soul or Will): Inscribing, activating, or countering glyphs tied to Nosgoth’s ley-lines. Used for magical traps, sigil-based attacks, and ward defenses. Skilled Glyphcasters can create timed or proximity-triggered effects or disable enemy glyphs. Essential for Glyph Seekers or Hylden Warlocks.
Rituals (Soul or Religion): Performing complex arcane or divine rites, requiring time and components. Used to summon spirits, consecrate land, seal portals, or alter fate. High ranks enable long-term enchantments or divine boons. Common among Sangromancers and Wardens.
Possession (Soul or Will): Controlling other beings, objects, or spectral anchors. Used by Wraiths or Razielim to enter host bodies, manipulate spirits, or transfer consciousness. High-risk, high-reward skill for escaping death or bypassing barriers.
Forbidden Knowledge (Will, Soul, or Focus): Insight into Hylden technology, fate codes, glyph decay, or time-stream fractures. Recognize cursed relics, navigate impossible timelines, or interpret prophecies. Risks Corruption or Sanity loss on failure.

Stealth & Subterfuge

Stealth (Shadow or Will): Moving silently and unseen past living or spectral sentries. Used for infiltration, ambushes, or escaping detection. High ranks allow vanishing in plain sight or traversing dangerous terrain unnoticed.
Deception (Presence or Will): Lying, bluffing, impersonation, or creating false narratives. Useful for espionage or social intrigue. Skilled deceivers can forge documents, mimic voices, or sow doubt. Contested by Insight.
Thievery (Shadow or Focus): Lockpicking, pickpocketing, disarming traps, and sleight-of-hand. Detect mechanical traps, crack enchanted locks, or create makeshift tools. Vital for dungeon crawling or urban survival.
Observation (Focus or Soul): Noticing hidden details, spotting enemies, or reading clues. Counters Stealth and Deception. High ranks predict ambushes, track by sight, or detect magical anomalies.

Social & Mental

Persuasion (Presence or Will): Influencing, bargaining, or inspiring others through charisma or reason. Convince NPCs, negotiate terms, or dissuade conflict. High ranks can sway crowds or halt attacks.
Presence (Fury or Will): Force of personality to intimidate, command, or awe. Suppress rebellion, rally allies, or terrify enemies. Used in battle or to demand attention.
Insight (Will or Focus): Reading emotions, detecting lies, or sensing intentions. Provides strategic social awareness, exposing manipulation or evaluating threats.
Concentration (Soul or Will): Mental endurance and resistance to distraction or corruption. Vital for casting under duress, resisting possession, or enduring supernatural stress.

Lore & Practical

History (Focus or Will): Knowledge of ancient events, bloodlines, and empires. Recognize ruins, recall battles, or identify key figures. Unlocks deeper lore and puzzle clues.
Religion (Soul or Will): Understanding faiths, divine entities, and sacred rites. Identify rituals, invoke divine powers, or gain insight into the Balance Pillars. Common among Wardens or Sarafan.
Nature (Will or Focus): Wilderness survival, animal tracking, and terrain navigation. Find paths, avoid hazards, or tame creatures. Useful for open-world exploration.
Craft (Focus or Soul): Building, repairing, or modifying weapons, armor, or glyph-based items. Includes forging, alchemy, and enchanting. Create traps, gear, or fortifications.

Playing the Skill System
The skill system drives both tactical combat and narrative exploration in Nosgoth. Invested skills and attributes make characters more reliable and cinematic, allowing players to shape the story through daring stunts, cunning deceptions, or forbidden knowledge. GMs should encourage creative use of skills, rewarding clever applications with narrative advantages or bonus effects.
A condensed version of the skill table is included on the character sheet for quick reference during character creation and leveling. As you navigate Nosgoth’s cursed landscapes, your skills will define your legend—whether as a bloodthirsty warrior, a spectral manipulator, or a keeper of forgotten truths.
