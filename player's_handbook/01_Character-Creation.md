Chapter 1: Level 1 Character Creation Guide
Welcome to the dark and perilous world of Nosgoth, where your character‚Äôs choices will shape their destiny. This guide will walk you through creating a Level 1 character, from their origins to their gear, ready to face the cursed realms of vampires, humans, wraiths, and Hylden. Follow these steps to forge a hero, villain, or something in between.
üß± Step 1: Concept & Background
Begin by envisioning your character‚Äôs core identity:

Choose your origin: Are you a cursed vampire noble, bound by ancient blood? A human Sarafan zealot, wielding faith against the undead? A spectral wraith, caught between life and death? Or perhaps another archetype that fits Nosgoth‚Äôs grim tapestry?
Determine your faction allegiance or independence: Are you loyal to a vampire clan, a human resistance, or do you walk alone?
Pick a core motivation: Is your character driven by vengeance, redemption, survival, or unraveling the mysteries of fate?

This step sets the narrative foundation for your character‚Äôs journey.
üß¨ Step 2: Choose a Race
Your character‚Äôs lineage defines their inherent abilities and connection to Nosgoth. Each race comes with unique traits and starting bonuses. Choose one:

Vampire:

Description: Immortal and cursed, vampires wield supernatural strength and blood-fueled powers.
Bonuses: +1 to Weapon Mastery and +1 to Stealth skills.
Unique Trait: Gain 1 Blood Point when near a dying creature.
Movement: Move through rubble without penalty; +1 to Stealth rolls in darkness or moonlight.
Narrative Hook: Bound by the wheel of fate and the blood of the ancients.


Human:

Description: Frail but defiant, humans are adaptable mortals fighting for survival.
Bonuses: Choose any two skills to receive a +1 bonus.
Unique Trait: Gain 1 extra perk every 4 levels.
Movement: Ignore one terrain penalty per session; +1 to Stealth in crowds.
Narrative Hook: The last flickers of resistance and redemption.


Wraith:

Description: Souls untethered from flesh, wraiths walk the boundary of life and death, manipulating the Spectral Realm.
Bonuses: +1 to Possession and +1 to Observation skills.
Unique Trait: Wraith Phasing allows translucency, movement through thin barriers, Soul damage ignoring physical armor, and resistance to non-magical physical damage.
Movement: Ignore terrain penalties; advantage on Stealth checks in the Spectral Realm.
Narrative Hook: Forgotten by death, hunted by time.


Hylden-Blooded:

Description: Exiled beings of entropy and dark invention, bearing ancient wrath.
Bonuses: +1 to Glyphcasting and +1 to Forbidden Knowledge skills.
Unique Trait: Cast one spell per long rest without cost, but take Corruption.
Movement: Full speed across corrupted or glyph-infused terrain; surge 10 ft once per scene when taking a Corruption Die.
Narrative Hook: Bearers of ancient wrath, seeking dominion or revenge.



üßô Step 3: Choose a Class
Select a class to define your character‚Äôs combat style and abilities. Each class grants unique perks, starting HP, a skill point pool (6‚Äì10 points), perk tree access, and starting gear. Examples include:

Blood Mage: Spellcaster focused on blood magic and life manipulation.
Sarafan Crusader: Frontline holy warrior with anti-undead bonuses.
Forbidden Scholar: Uses corrupted spells and arcane relics.
Outcast Warden: Hybrid survivalist and rogue.

Consult your GM for the full class list and specific perks.
üé≤ Step 4: Assign Attributes
Distribute 15 points across six attributes, with a maximum of 3 per attribute. Each governs specific aspects of your character:

Fury: Aggression and emotional force. Governs raw power, rage, and intimidation. Key for classes like Blood Knight or Dreadblade. Linked to skills like Weapon Mastery and Presence.
Soul: Spiritual power and connection to the Spectral Realm. Crucial for spellcasters like Soul Reaver or Glyph Seeker. Influences Soul Energy and skills like Glyphcasting and Possession.
Shadow: Stealth, evasion, and subtlety. Core for Shadowmancer or Dreadblade. Linked to Stealth, Evasion, and Thievery.
Will: Mental resilience and discipline. Key for Glyph Seeker or Hylden Warlock. Used for resisting mental assaults and skills like Tactics and Insight.
Focus: Mental acuity and precision. Important for perception and complex tasks. Linked to Observation, History, and Craft.
Blood: Physical vitality and life essence. Core for Blood Knight or Sangromancer. Influences Blood Point reserves and blood magic.

Calculating Starting Resource Pools

Soul Energy (SE): For classes using Soul Energy, maximum SE = 3 + Will attribute + 1 (Character Level / 2, rounded up). See the Spellcasting in Nosgoth section for details.
Blood Points (BP): For classes or lineages using Blood Points, maximum BP = 4 + Shadow attribute + 1. See the Spellcasting in Nosgoth section for details.

üß† Step 5: Assign Skills
Assign skill points (typically 6‚Äì10, based on class and race) to skills like Glyphcasting, Weapon Mastery, Stealth, or Forbidden Knowledge. Each skill is tied to an attribute and contributes to dice pools.

At Level 1, no skill rank can exceed 3 or the highest associated attribute (e.g., Weapon Mastery cannot exceed your Fury or Shadow if either is 2).
The absolute maximum for any skill is 5 ranks.
Consult the Skill-to-Attribute Summary Table for associations.

üó° Step 6: Choose Starting Gear
