Hereâ€™s a polished **chapter draft** that merges your *Dice Success System* and *Combat Rules* into a single structured rules chapter. I kept it in a style consistent with a tabletop RPG corebookâ€”clear, modular, and with headings for easy reference.

# Chapter 3: Dice & Combat System

## ðŸŽ² Dice Success System

The Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG uses a **D6-based success system**. This mechanic drives all core actions, from combat to exploration, and is designed to emphasize risk, tension, and the dramatic weight of every roll.

### Rolling Dice

* Players roll a **pool of D6s** equal to **Attribute + Skill**.
* **5 or 6 = 1 Success.**
* The number of successes required for any **non-combat task** is determined by its **Difficulty Rating (DR)**. This is a number set by the Game Master, typically from 1 to 4, based on the challenge's complexity.

| DR | Challenge Level | Required Successes |
| -- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1  | Trivial         | 1 success          |
| 2  | Challenging     | 2 successes        |
| 3  | Dangerous       | 3 successes        |
| 4+ | Severe          | 4+ successes       |

**Resolution:**

* **1 success = success** (action completes as intended).
* **0 successes = failure** (action fails, complications may arise).

---

### ðŸ’¥ Extra Successes: Enhancing Actions

If a player rolls more successes than required, they may choose to **enhance their outcome**:

**In Combat:**

* +1 damage per extra success (up to weapon or GM limit).
* Inflict a status effect based on the attack's damage type (see below).
* Strike multiple targets (GM discretion).
* Ignore 1 point of armor per extra success.

**Status Effects by Damage Type:**

Spending extra successes allows you to apply a status effect, but the available effects are determined by the damage type of your attack.

*   **Bludgeoning**: *Staggered* (target cannot take Reactions until their next turn) or *Prone* (target falls).
*   **Piercing**: *Deep Wounds* (disadvantage on physical checks for 1 round).
*   **Slashing**: *Bleeding* (1 damage at the start of their turn for 2 rounds).
*   **Fire**: *Burning* (2 damage per round for 2 rounds, extinguished with a DR 2 action).
*   **Cold**: *Slowed* (movement halved for 1 round) or *Frozen* (immobilized for 1 round, DR 3 to break free).
*   **Lightning**: *Shocked* (disadvantage on attacks for 1 round).
*   **Soul**: *Soul Stress* (disadvantage on Will or Soul-based checks for 1 round).
*   **Radiant**: *Blinded* (disadvantage on attacks and perception checks for creatures of darkness).
*   **Necrotic**: *Weakened* (â€“2 damage on next attack).
*   **Force**: *Pushed* (target is moved 5 feet) or *Prone*.

Some damage types have unique effects that are not traditional statuses:
*   **Soulfire**: *Blighted* (prevents natural healing for 1 round).
*   **Corruption**: *Corruption Point* (adds to targetâ€™s Corruption track).
*   **Void**: *Frayed Reality* (â€“2 dice on next saving throw).

**Outside Combat:**

* Perform faster, quieter, or with added flair.
* Gain a narrative advantage (e.g., spotting details, creating openings).
* Create a stunt (leap to higher ground, grab an item mid-battle, etc.).

### ðŸŽ² Advantage & Disadvantage

Advantage and Disadvantage modify the **dice pool before rolling**:

| Modifier Level | Dice Adjustment | Example Situations           |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Minor          | Â±1 die          | Low cover, brief distraction |
| Moderate       | Â±2 dice         | High ground, magical aid     |
| Major          | Â±3 dice         | Perfect ambush, cursed foe   |

* **Advantage:** Add bonus dice (up to +3).
* **Disadvantage:** After rolling, remove that many *highest dice* before counting.
* **Canceling:** They negate each other 1-for-1.

**Narrative Adjudication:**
The GM decides how extra successes manifest, but players are encouraged to propose creative outcomes.

*Examples:*

* 4 successes on a DR 2 Stealth check: not only succeed, but also disable a trap silently.
* 3 successes on a DR 1 attack: cleave through a shield or decapitate the target.

## âš” Combat System

Combat in Nosgoth reflects the brutal, tactical, and often supernatural struggle of its denizens. Every exchange carries weightâ€”each strike a test of willpower, blood, and fate.

### ðŸ§® Initiative

* Roll D6s equal to **Shadow + (Tactics or Concentration)**.
* Highest number of successes acts first.
* Ties broken by Shadow stat, then GM discretion.

---

### ðŸ—¡ Attacks

1. Roll a pool equal to **Attribute + Weapon Mastery**.
2. Each 5â€“6 = 1 success.
3. Compare successes to targetâ€™s **Defense Value (DV)**.

   * DV = number of successes needed to hit.
4. Excess successes = bonus damage or special effects.

*Example:* Roll = 6, 5, 3, 2 â†’ 2 successes.
Target DV = 1 â†’ hit. One excess success remains (usable for bonus damage or an effect).

---

### ðŸ›¡ Defense & Armor

* **DV:** Base = 1 + (Shadow or Will, higher). Modified by armor, perks, or effects.
* **Armor:** Flat reduction of damage (e.g., -2 damage).
* **Active Defense:** Characters may roll reactions such as Dodge or Parry.

---

### ðŸ’¥ Damage & Health

* **Weapons/abilities** define base damage.
* **Health Points (HP):** Track physical harm.
* 0 HP â†’ unconscious or dying.
* Certain attacks may cause **Wounds or Sanity Loss**.

---

### ðŸ§  Special Actions

* **Spellcasting:** Roll **Soul + Glyphcasting**.
* **Grappling:** Use Unarmed Combat to restrain/disarm.
* **Shifting Realms:** Abilities may allow shifting between Spectral/Material realms mid-combat.
* **Pushes:** Players may reroll failures by adding a **Corruption Die (CD)**.

---

### ðŸ’£ Critical Hits & Failures

* **Critical Hit:** 3+ successes, or exceeding DV by 2+.

  * May stun, bypass armor, or deal bonus damage.
* **Critical Failure:** 0 successes + failed push with CD rolling a 1.

  * Triggers corruption backlash or GM complication.

---

### ðŸ§¬ Environmental Combat

* The battlefield may feature **Spectral/Material terrain, glyph traps, cursed objects**.
* Players can **interact with or destroy terrain** using Strength or Craft.

---

### âš¡ Reactions

Each character gets **1 Reaction per round**.

**Trigger Examples:**

* Being targeted by an attack.
* An enemy moving within reach.
* A spell being cast at the character.

**Common Reactions:**

* *Dodge:* Shadow + Evasion â†’ avoid an attack.
* *Parry:* Fury + Weapon Mastery â†’ reduce melee damage.
* *Counterspell:* Soul + Glyphcasting â†’ negate magic.
* *Opportunity Attack:* Strike fleeing/approaching foes.
* *Spectral Shift:* Instantly phase (if trait/spell allows).

**Reaction Roll Outcomes:**

| Successes | Effect                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Reduce damage by 1                          |
| 2         | Reduce damage by 2 OR negate status         |
| 3+        | Halve damage or fully evade (GM discretion) |

## Closing Note

Combat in Nosgoth is **visceral and cinematic**, blending the brutality of battle with the mysticism of the realms. Success is never binaryâ€”extra successes create opportunities for stunts, narrative flourishes, and dramatic escalation. Power always comes with a price, and the dice ensure that every moment hangs in the balance.
