# Chapter 0: Core Mechanics

## Overview

Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG uses a d6 dice pool system where players roll a number of six-sided dice equal to their relevant Attribute + Skill combination. Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success. The number of successes determines whether an action succeeds and how well it's performed.

## The Dice Pool System

### Basic Resolution
1. **Determine Your Dice Pool:** Attribute + Skill (e.g., Fury 3 + Weapon Mastery 2 = 5 dice)
2. **Roll All Dice:** Each die showing 5 or 6 = 1 success
3. **Compare to Target:** Number of successes determines outcome

### Success Thresholds
- **0 Successes:** Complete failure
- **1 Success:** Minimal success, barely adequate
- **2+ Successes:** Clear success with increasing quality
- **3+ Successes:** Exceptional success (Critical Success for skill checks, Critical Hit for combat)

---

## Difficulty Rating (DR) vs Defense Value (DV)

### Difficulty Rating (DR)
**Used for: Skill checks, environmental challenges, saving throws**

DR represents the number of successes needed to accomplish a task:
- **DR 1 (Simple):** Basic tasks, favorable conditions
- **DR 2 (Standard):** Average challenges, typical obstacles
- **DR 3 (Challenging):** Difficult tasks requiring expertise
- **DR 4+ (Severe):** Nearly impossible feats, extreme challenges

**Examples:**
- Climbing a wall with handholds: DR 1
- Picking a standard lock: DR 2
- Deciphering ancient runes: DR 3
- Disarming a master-crafted trap: DR 4

### Defense Value (DV)
**Used for: Combat attacks only**

DV represents how hard a creature is to hit in combat:
- **Base DV = 1 + (higher of Shadow or Will attribute)**
- DV is modified by armor, cover, and tactical advantages
- Attackers must roll successes ≥ target's DV to hit

**Example:** A character with Shadow 3 and Will 2 has Base DV = 1 + 3 = 4

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

### Advantage
**When you have an edge on a roll:**
- Roll your normal dice pool
- **Re-roll all dice that showed 1-4 (failures)**
- Add any new successes to your original successes
- Keep the total

**Common Sources:**
- Attacking from stealth or surprise
- Beneficial positioning (high ground, flanking)
- Environmental factors (attacking in darkness as a Shadowmancer)
- Ally assistance

### Disadvantage
**When you're hindered on a roll:**
- Roll your normal dice pool
- **Re-roll all dice that showed 5-6 (successes)**
- Keep only the results of the re-rolled dice
- Your original successes are replaced

**Common Sources:**
- Poor positioning
- Environmental hazards
- Status effects (Blinded, Frightened)
- Unfavorable conditions

---

## Critical Success vs Critical Hit

### Critical Success
**Applies to: Skill checks (non-combat)**

Achieved when you roll 3+ successes on a skill check OR exceed the DR by 2+

**Benefits (choose one):**
- Gain additional narrative advantage or information
- Complete the task faster or more efficiently
- Create an opportunity for allies
- GM may offer unique options based on context

**Examples:**
- Critical lockpicking: Also learn about the lock's creator
- Critical investigation: Discover hidden clues others missed
- Critical persuasion: Turn enemy into temporary ally

### Critical Hit
**Applies to: Combat attacks only**

Achieved when you roll 3+ successes on an attack roll OR exceed target's DV by 2+

**Benefits (choose one):**
- **Bonus Damage:** Deal +2 or +3 additional damage
- **Status Effect:** Inflict condition (Staggered, Bleeding, Prone)
- **Bypass Armor:** Ignore 1 or 2 points of target's Armor
- **Tactical Advantage:** Create opening for allies

**Example:** Attacking enemy with DV 3. You roll 5 successes → Critical Hit! You deal extra damage and knock them prone.

## Pushing Rolls

Sometimes characters need to push beyond their limits. This system allows re-rolling failures at the cost of Corruption.

### How to Push a Roll
1. **Declare Before Rolling:** You must decide to push before making your initial roll
2. **Pay the Cost:** Roll a number of Corruption Dice equal to (Corruption Level ÷ 3, rounded up) from your Corruption Pool
3. **Resolve Corruption Dice:**
   - **1 = Taint:** Immediate complication (see Chapter 8: Corruption)
   - **2-4 = Neutral:** No effect
   - **5-6 = Success:** Each adds 1 success to your total
4. **Apply Results:** Add Corruption successes to your main roll total

**You must spend all Corruption Pool dice each session.** See Chapter 8: Corruption for full details.

**Example:** Lyssa has Corruption Level 6. She pushes a roll, spending 2 Corruption Dice (6÷3=2). She rolls [1, 5] → 1 Taint (complication) + 1 Success added to her roll.
