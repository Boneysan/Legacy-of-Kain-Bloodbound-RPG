# Chapter 0: Core Mechanics

## Overview

Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG uses a d6 dice pool system where players roll a number of six-sided dice equal to their relevant Attribute + Skill combination. Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success. The number of successes determines whether an action succeeds and how well it's performed.

## The Dice Pool System

### Basic Resolution
1. **Determine Your Dice Pool:** Attribute + Skill (e.g., Fury 3 + Weapon Mastery 2 = 5 dice)
2. **Roll All Dice:** Each die showing 5 or 6 = 1 success
3. **Compare to Target:** Number of successes determines outcome

### Success Thresholds
- **0 Successes:** Complete failure
- **1 Success:** Minimal success, barely adequate
- **2+ Successes:** Clear success with increasing quality
- **3+ Successes:** Exceptional success (Critical Success for skill checks, Critical Hit for combat)

---

## Difficulty Rating (DR) vs Defense Value (DV)

### Difficulty Rating (DR)
**Used for: Skill checks, environmental challenges, saving throws**

DR represents the number of successes needed to accomplish a task:
- **DR 1 (Simple):** Basic tasks, favorable conditions
- **DR 2 (Standard):** Average challenges, typical obstacles
- **DR 3 (Challenging):** Difficult tasks requiring expertise
- **DR 4+ (Severe):** Nearly impossible feats, extreme challenges

**Examples:**
- Climbing a wall with handholds: DR 1
- Picking a standard lock: DR 2
- Deciphering ancient runes: DR 3
- Disarming a master-crafted trap: DR 4

### Defense Value (DV)
**Used for: Combat attacks only**

DV represents how hard a creature is to hit in combat:
- **Base DV = 1 + (higher of Shadow or Will attribute)**
- DV is modified by armor, cover, and tactical advantages
- Attackers must roll successes ≥ target's DV to hit

**Example:** A character with Shadow 3 and Will 2 has Base DV = 1 + 3 = 4

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

### Advantage
**When you have an edge on a roll:**
- Roll your normal dice pool
- **Re-roll all dice that showed 1-4 (failures)**
- Add any new successes to your original successes
- Keep the total

**Common Sources:**
- Attacking from stealth or surprise
- Beneficial positioning (high ground, flanking)
- Environmental factors (attacking in darkness as a Shadowmancer)
- Ally assistance

### Disadvantage
**When you're hindered on a roll:**
- Roll your normal dice pool
- **Re-roll all dice that showed 5-6 (successes)**
- Keep only the results of the re-rolled dice
- Your original successes are replaced

**Common Sources:**
- Poor positioning
- Environmental hazards
- Status effects (Blinded, Frightened)
- Unfavorable conditions

---

## Critical Success vs Critical Hit

### Critical Success
**Applies to: Skill checks (non-combat)**

Achieved when you roll 3+ successes on a skill check OR exceed the DR by 2+

**Benefits (choose one):**
- Gain additional narrative advantage or information
- Complete the task faster or more efficiently
- Create an opportunity for allies
- GM may offer unique options based on context

**Examples:**
- Critical lockpicking: Also learn about the lock's creator
- Critical investigation: Discover hidden clues others missed
- Critical persuasion: Turn enemy into temporary ally

### Critical Hit
**Applies to: Combat attacks only**

Achieved when you roll 3+ successes on an attack roll OR exceed target's DV by 2+

**Benefits (choose one):**
- **Bonus Damage:** Deal +2 or +3 additional damage
- **Status Effect:** Inflict condition (Staggered, Bleeding, Prone)
- **Bypass Armor:** Ignore 1 or 2 points of target's Armor
- **Tactical Advantage:** Create opening for allies

**Example:** Attacking enemy with DV 3. You roll 5 successes → Critical Hit! You deal extra damage and knock them prone.

## Pushing Rolls

Sometimes characters need to push beyond their limits. This system allows you to force a success at the risk of Corruption.

### How to Push a Roll
When desperate, you can tap into the corrupted energies of Nosgoth to turn failure into success.

1. **Declare the Push:** You may push *after* seeing the result of a failed roll.
2. **Add Corruption Dice:** Choose to add **1, 2, or 3** additional d6s (Corruption Dice) to your result.
   - Each **5** or **6** on these dice adds a success to your total.
   - Each **1** on these dice increases your **Corruption Level by 1**.
3. **The Limit:**
   - If your Corruption Level reaches **15**, your character is lost to madness or the abyss (becoming an NPC).

**Example:**
Lyssa fails a critical attack roll with 2 successes against DV 3. She chooses to Push with **2 Corruption Dice**. She rolls a 5 and a 1.
- The 5 adds a success (Total: 3), allowing her to hit.
- The 1 increases her Corruption Level by 1 immediately.
