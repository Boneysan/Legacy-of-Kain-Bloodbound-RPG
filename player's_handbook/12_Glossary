# Chapter 12: Glossary

## Short Rest (Moment's Respite)

Duration: Approximately 1 hour.

Activity: A brief period of relative calm where characters can recover from immediate strain in a minimally secure environment. Strenuous activities like combat, casting demanding spells, or extensive travel interrupt this rest.

Mortals (Humans, some Hylden): Focus on bandaging wounds, consuming a hurried meal, maintaining gear, or keeping watch.
Vampires: Enter a state of unnatural stillness, drawing on ambient darkness or a light trance in a secure location. They may clean weapons or hone predatory instincts. A quick, minimal feeding from a vulnerable or willing source may occur but is less restorative than a proper hunt.
Wraiths: Withdraw deeper into the Spectral Realm or coalesce their spectral form, drawing on minor ambient soul echoes or emotional residue.
Revenants: Reassert will over their decaying form, re-knitting minor damage through force of will or performing small rites to appease binding forces.


Benefits:

Make a Focus or Will check to remove 1 point of a specific type of Stress.
Regain a small amount of HP (e.g., 1d6 + Focus attribute, or a quarter of max HP). If using a "Hit Dice" mechanic, spend them here.
Refresh abilities designated as "per short rest" in class or lineage descriptions.
Regain 1 expended use of a "per scene" ability, if not heavily used.



## Long Rest (Abyssal Slumber)

Duration: At least 6–8 hours of largely uninterrupted downtime in a secure environment. Interruptions (e.g., an hour or more of combat or strenuous activity) negate benefits.

Activity:

Mortals: Require full sleep, often in shifts, in a secure location like a hidden sanctuary or fortified room.
Vampires: Enter a significant torpor or meditative state in a secure sanctum (e.g., coffin, crypt, or place of power). A recent significant feeding is crucial for full benefits; without it, rest may be incomplete or draining, affecting Blood Point recovery.
Wraiths: Immerse deeply in the Spectral Realm near a soul font, memory nexus, or thin veil, fully re-cohering essence and replenishing Soul Energy.
Revenants: Reassert control over their decaying form through rituals, replacing rotted components or re-inscribing binding runes.


Benefits:

Regain all or most lost HP.
Fully restore resource pools (e.g., Soul Energy, Blood Points for vampires, contingent on recent feeding or secure rest).
Refresh abilities designated as "per long rest" (e.g., Wraith’s Phasing, Kain’s Chrono Reversal).
Make progress on recovering from severe Stress or Corruption via checks or roleplaying.
Perform longer activities like complex Rituals, Crafting, or deciphering Forbidden Knowledge.


Key Considerations:

Resource Costs: Mortals need food and water; vampires require blood, creating constant pressure.
Safety & Interruption: Resting is rarely safe in Nosgoth. Failed Stealth checks or random encounters may interrupt rests, denying benefits and adding tension.
Lineage Specifics: Each lineage rests uniquely (e.g., Zephonim dissolve into insect swarms, Dumahim enter stone-like slumber), enhancing flavor.



## Sanity
Sanity represents a character’s mental resilience against Nosgoth’s horrors, forbidden knowledge, and reality-bending forces. It measures psychological integrity, eroded by "sanity damage" from terrifying entities, Hylden magic, spells like Nightmare Seed, or psychic trauma. Particularly central to classes like the Hylden Warlock, any character may face Sanity tests.

Effects of Sanity Loss:

Depleting Sanity or failing Will-based saving throws can cause madness-related conditions, severe mental states (e.g., paranoia, catatonia), or other psychological consequences.
Some abilities allow deliberate Sanity expenditure for powerful effects.


Resistance and Recovery:

Resist Sanity loss via Will-based saving throws or specific perks.
Recover Sanity during rests or through potent magical intervention for severe cases.



## Scenes
A scene is a narrative segment, such as a combat encounter, social negotiation, or exploration sequence. Scene-based abilities (e.g., “once per scene”) reset when transitioning to a new context, like moving from battle to conversation or changing major locations. Requires one Tier 2 perk.
