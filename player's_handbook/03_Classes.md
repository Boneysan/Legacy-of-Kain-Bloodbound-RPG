# Chapter 3: Classes and Perks
In the blood-soaked ruins of Nosgoth, where the Wheel of Fate grinds souls to dust, characters rise as avatars of power, defiance, or despair. The Classes of Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG embody mythic archetypes, each tied to Nosgoth’s fractured history of vampiric wars, spectral unrest, and cosmic betrayal. From the relentless fury of Blood Knights to the entropy-wielding Hylden Warlocks, every class carries a legacy that shapes their abilities and narrative destiny. This chapter details the eight core classes, their lore, mechanics, and progression, alongside the Universal Perks System that allows characters to transcend their roles, and the perilous Corrupted Perks that tempt with forbidden power.

Note on terminology: DV is for attacks, DR is for checks and saves, and Armor is flat mitigation. Damage types like Force, Spectral, and Entropic have special interactions detailed in Chapters 5, 8, and 9. For faction and setting context, see Lore — World Primer.

## 3.1 Class Overview
Each class reflects a unique aspect of Nosgoth’s mythos, blending martial prowess, arcane mastery, and divine purpose. Players select a class at character creation, defining their core abilities, stats, and role in the party. Progression includes Class Perks (gained every level) and Universal Perks (gained at specific milestones), with humans receiving additional perks via their racial trait. Corrupted Perks offer dark power at a cost, unlocked through narrative events or a Corruption Threshold.
## 3.2 Class Progression

Starting Stats: Each class begins with 5–6 skill points, 8–12 starting HP, and +4–6 HP per level.
Skill Progression: Gain +1 skill point per level to allocate to skills like Weapon Mastery, Stealth, or Glyphcasting.
Core Attributes: Each class has two core stats (e.g., Fury, Soul) that drive abilities. At Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, increase one core attribute by 1 (max 5).
Class Perks: Gain one Class Perk per level (1–20), chosen from the class’s specific list for that level.
Universal Perks: Gain one Universal Perk slot at Levels 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 20, following tier unlock conditions (see Universal Perks System).
Human Racial Trait: Humans gain one extra Universal Perk at Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, following tier restrictions.
Multiclassing: At Level 5+, players may request a Tier 1 perk from another class’s tree with GM approval, enabling hybrid builds (e.g., a Blood Mage with Outcast stealth perks).
Custom Perks: GMs may create unique perks tied to backstory, story moments, or relics (e.g., Blade of the Broken Circle: +3 damage vs. former allies, once per session).

## 3.3 Universal Perks Progression

Tier 1 (Levels 1–5): Foundational perks; no prerequisites.
Tier 2 (Levels 6–10): Requires one Tier 1 Universal Perk; may choose lower-tier perks.
Tier 3 (Levels 11–15): Requires one Tier 2 Universal Perk; may choose lower-tier perks.
Tier 4 (Levels 16–20): Requires one Tier 3 Universal Perk; may choose lower-tier perks.

Corrupted Perks
Corrupted Perks tempt with forbidden power, unlocked via a Corruption Threshold (score 0–15) or narrative triggers (e.g., Hylden pacts). Each carries drawbacks, reflecting Nosgoth’s cost of power.
Corruption Threshold Mechanics

Dice Rolls: Roll 2 × Corruption Level d6 per session (DC 10). Failure inflicts Sanity loss or narrative penalties. Pushing rolls adds (Corruption Level / 3, rounded up) d6.
Social/Environmental Impact:
1–2 (Touched): Minor unsettling aura.
3–6 (Marked): -1 die social rolls with pure NPCs; dim lights, agitated animals.
7–10 (Deeply Corrupted): -2 die social rolls; -1 die in pure areas.
11–15 (Abyss-Bound): -3 die social rolls; attract dark entities; -2 die in sanctified zones.
