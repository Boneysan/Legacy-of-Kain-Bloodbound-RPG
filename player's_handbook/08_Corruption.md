# Chapter 8: Corruption

*“Embrace your hunger, your lust, your desire… for in these things, you will find your true strength.”*

In the cursed land of Nosgoth, power and damnation are often intertwined. Corruption is a measure of a character’s willingness to embrace their darker nature—be it through forbidden magic, unnatural transformations, or forbidden knowledge. It is not a simple measure of evil, but a representation of a dangerous, volatile power that grows within.

This system treats Corruption as a double-edged sword. As your taint deepens, you unlock potent and terrible abilities. But this power comes at a price, demanding to be unleashed and carrying with it the constant risk of backfiring in spectacular fashion.

## 8.1 Corruption Level and Thresholds

Your **Corruption Level** is a score from 0 to 15 that tracks how far you have fallen into darkness. A character begins with 0 Corruption unless a racial or class trait specifies otherwise. As your Corruption Level increases, you cross thresholds that unlock access to powerful **Corrupted Perks**.

| Corruption Level | State                 | Effect                                       |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2              | Touched by Corruption | Roleplaying cues begin; no perks yet.        |
| 3–6              | Marked by Corruption  | Tier 1 Corrupted Perks become available.     |
| 7–10             | Deeply Corrupted      | Tier 2 Corrupted Perks become available.     |
| 11–15            | Abyss-Bound           | Tier 3 Corrupted Perks become available.     |

**Gaining Corruption Levels:**
A character’s Corruption Level increases through significant narrative events, not minor actions. This should be a deliberate choice made by the player in pursuit of power.
*   Performing a major forbidden ritual.
*   Making a pact with a powerful dark entity.
*   Permanently binding a cursed artifact to your soul.
*   Undergoing a monstrous physical transformation.

## 8.2 The Corruption Pool

The power granted by Corruption is volatile and demands to be used. This is represented by the **Corruption Pool**.

At the start of each game session, if your Corruption Level is 3 or higher, you gain a **Corruption Pool** of d6s equal to **twice your current Corruption Level**. These dice are kept separate from your normal dice pool.

*Example: A character with a Corruption Level of 4 starts the session with a Corruption Pool of 8 dice (4 x 2 = 8).*

### The Debt of Power
You **must** use all the dice in your Corruption Pool by the end of the session. This represents your inner darkness demanding expression. If the session ends and you have dice remaining in your pool, your bottled-up power lashes out. For every die remaining, you suffer 1 point of damage that bypasses armor, and the GM may impose a significant narrative complication (e.g., a temporary monstrous feature appears, or an important ally becomes deeply distrustful).

### Spending Corruption Dice
You spend dice from your Corruption Pool in two ways:
1.  **Activating Corrupted Perks:** Many Corrupted Perks will require you to spend one or more dice from your pool to activate them.
2.  **Pushing a Roll:** When you fail a roll, you can spend dice from the pool to try and turn failure into success.

## 8.3 Rolling Corruption Dice

Whenever you spend one or more dice from your Corruption Pool, you roll them. These dice do not use the standard success rules; instead, they have their own unique outcomes:

*   **On a 1 (Taint):** The power manifests with a negative consequence. The Game Master chooses a complication appropriate to the situation. This could be taking 1 damage that bypasses armor, revealing your tainted nature to onlookers, causing a friendly NPC to become fearful, or having a spell misfire in a minor but inconvenient way.
*   **On a 2–4 (Neutral):** The power works as intended, with no additional effect.
*   **On a 5–6 (Success):** The power works as intended, AND the die counts as **1 Success**. If the roll was part of a skill check or attack, you add this success to your total. If you were just activating a perk, this success is simply a surge of potency with no mechanical effect, unless the perk says otherwise.

## 8.4 Pushing a Roll

When you fail a roll, you can choose to push it by drawing on your inner darkness.
1.  Declare you are pushing the roll.
2.  Spend a number of dice from your **Corruption Pool** equal to **your Corruption Level divided by 3 (rounded up)**.
3.  Roll these Corruption Dice. Add any successes (from rolls of 5 or 6) to your initial roll's total. You must also resolve any Taint effects (from rolls of 1).

*Example: A character with Corruption Level 5 fails a roll. They decide to push it. They must spend and roll **2 dice** (5 / 3 = 1.66, rounded up to 2) from their Corruption Pool. If they roll a 1 and a 6, they suffer a Taint complication but also add 1 success to their original roll's total.*

## 8.5 Other Effects of Corruption

Beyond the Corruption Pool, a high level of taint has other narrative effects:

*   **Social Reactions:** NPCs, particularly those aligned with order or faith (like the Sarafan), will react more negatively to characters with a palpable aura of taint, leading to social penalties or outright hostility. Conversely, dark entities might show increased interest or offer unique opportunities.
*   **Environmental Interaction:** Heavily corrupted characters might find themselves subtly influencing their environment (e.g., lights dimming, shadows deepening). They may also feel pain or weakness in areas of strong purity or sanctification.

## 8.6 Paths to Purification

Reducing one's Corruption Level is an arduous and monumental task, representing a character's attempt to reclaim their soul. This should be the focus of a major personal quest and is entirely at the GM's discretion. There is no simple cure; redemption must be earned through great effort and sacrifice. Below are several paths a character might take. These methods can even be combined, with a character undertaking a quest for an artifact as part of a grand Act of Atonement.

### 1. Rituals of Purification
These are demanding, often ancient, and perilous rites that directly confront and attempt to expel corrupting influences. Success is not guaranteed, and failure can be costly.

*   **Discovery:** The knowledge of such rituals is rare, possibly found in forgotten lore, learned from a unique NPC, or pieced together from fragmented texts.
*   **Components:** Rituals require specific, often rare and difficult-to-obtain material components (e.g., Tears of a repentant innocent, a heartwood branch from an uncorrupted tree, dust from a Pillar of Nosgoth).
*   **Location:** The rite must be performed at a specific location, such as a restored holy site or a place of natural power untouched by corruption.
*   **The Rite:** The ritual itself is a dramatic scene, likely taking hours or days and involving one or more difficult skill checks (e.g. Soul + Rituals or Will + Concentration) at a high DR. Failure could lead to backlash, such as increasing Corruption or attracting hostile entities.

### 2. Acts of Atonement or Defiance
This method ties Corruption reduction to significant narrative choices and character development, where a character actively works against the nature of their corruption.

*   **Significant Narrative Acts:** These are not minor good deeds but substantial, perilous actions that demonstrate a change of heart. For example, a vampire corrupted by ruthless feeding might undertake a quest to protect a human settlement, or a Hylden Warlock might destroy a powerful Hylden artifact they were meant to use.
*   **GM Adjudication:** The GM determines what constitutes a truly significant act worthy of reducing Corruption. The reduction is a reward for the narrative achievement, not a simple roll.

### 3. Seeking Aid from Unique NPCs
Nosgoth is filled with ancient beings who might possess the ability to cleanse Corruption, though their aid will rarely come without a price.

*   **The Price of Aid:** An ancient vampire, a powerful Warden of Balance, or a mysterious Oracle might demand a significant service, a rare artifact, or a binding oath in return for their help. This forms the basis of a new quest.
*   **The Process:** The method of cleansing would depend on the entity and could involve a unique ritual they perform, a trial the character must undergo, or a direct transference of power.

### 4. Downtime Activities & Focused Contemplation
This method offers a slower, more introspective path to resisting or slightly reducing Corruption between major adventures.

*   **Activities:** A character can spend significant downtime (weeks or months) in focused meditation, spiritual cleansing, or research.
*   **Mechanics:** This would be represented by a series of skill checks (e.g., Will + Concentration) over the downtime period. Cumulative successes might lead to a small reduction in Corruption or grant a temporary bonus to resist its effects.
*   **Limited Effect:** This method represents a character's personal struggle and would generally result in minor reductions, not a complete cleansing.
