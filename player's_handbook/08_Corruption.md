# Chapter 8: Corruption

*“Embrace your hunger, your lust, your desire… for in these things, you will find your true strength.”*

In the cursed land of Nosgoth, power and damnation are often intertwined. Corruption is a measure of a character’s willingness to embrace their darker nature—be it through forbidden magic, unnatural transformations, or forbidden knowledge. It is not a simple measure of evil, but a representation of a dangerous, volatile power that grows within.

This system treats Corruption as a double-edged sword. As your taint deepens, you unlock potent and terrible abilities. But this power comes at a price, demanding to be unleashed and carrying with it the constant risk of backfiring in spectacular fashion.

Note on terminology: DV is for attacks, DR is for checks and saves, and Armor is flat mitigation. Damage types like Force, Spectral, and Entropic have special interactions detailed in Chapters 5, 8, and 9.

## 8.1 Corruption Level and Thresholds

Your **Corruption Level** is a score from 0 to 15 that tracks how far you have fallen into darkness. A character begins with 0 Corruption unless a racial or class trait specifies otherwise. As your Corruption Level increases, you cross thresholds that unlock access to powerful **Corrupted Perks**—but also bring you closer to losing your character entirely.

| Corruption Level | State                 | Effect                                       |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2              | Touched by Corruption | Roleplaying cues begin; no perks yet.        |
| 3–6              | Marked by Corruption  | Tier 1 Corrupted Perks become available.     |
| 7–10             | Deeply Corrupted      | Tier 2 Corrupted Perks become available.     |
| 11–14            | Abyss-Bound           | Tier 3 Corrupted Perks become available.     |
| 15               | Lost                  | Character becomes an NPC (monster).          |

**Gaining Corruption Levels:**
A character’s Corruption Level increases typically through:
*   **Rolling a 1 on a Corruption Die.**
*   Performing forbidden rituals or using corrupt artifacts.
*   Suffering **Entropic Damage** from specific enemies.

## 8.2 Pushing a Roll

The most common way to tempt fate is to **Push** a failed roll. When you fail a skill check or attack roll, you may choose to draw upon your dark power to force a success.

1.  **Declare:** You may push *after* seeing the result of the initial roll.
2.  **Add Dice:** You choose to add **1, 2, or 3 Corruption Dice (d6)** to your pool.
3.  **Resolve:** 
    *   **5 or 6**: Adds 1 Success to your total.
    *   **1**: Increases your **Corruption Level by 1**.
    *   **2-4**: No effect.

*Example: Raziel fails an attack with 2 successes against DV 3. He pushes with 2 Corruption Dice. He rolls a 5 and a 1. The 5 adds a success (Total 3, Hit!), but the 1 increases his Corruption Level.*

## 8.3 Rolling Corruption Dice

Corruption Dice are always d6s, but they are distinct from your normal dice (use a different color if possible). They are used when:
1.  **Pushing a Roll** (see above).
2.  **Activating Corrupted Perks** (some perks require rolling Corruption Dice).

**The Risk:**
Whenever a Corruption Die shows a **1**, your Corruption Level increases by 1 immediately. If this pushes you over a threshold, you may gain a new perk or eventually lose your character.

## 8.4 Corrupted Perks

As you cross Corruption thresholds, you gain access to powerful but dangerous Corrupted Perks.

*   **Tier 1 (Level 3+)**: Minor powers with social drawbacks.
*   **Tier 2 (Level 7+)**: Significant powers with physical costs or risks.
*   **Tier 3 (Level 11+)**: Game-altering powers that threaten your sanity.

Characters may select one Corrupted Perk each time they cross a new threshold.

### Tier 1 Corrupted Perks (Corruption Level 3-6)

#### Bloodstained Sight

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per scene, you can focus on blood-soaked terrain or a bleeding creature within 30 feet (6 squares) to gain +1 die on Observation checks for 1 minute, revealing hidden enemies or spectral traces.

**Drawback:** After using this ability, you become fixated on blood; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save to avoid attacking or feeding on the nearest bleeding creature (ally or foe) on your next turn. Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for that turn.

**Narrative Flavor:** Your senses sharpen, drawn to the pulse of life in blood, but it awakens a primal urge. Your pupils dilate unnaturally, and you may lick your lips involuntarily. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, emphasizing their bloodlust while offering utility.

#### Spectral Whisper

**Effect (Passive):** You gain +1 die on Stealth checks in the Spectral Realm or areas of obscuring terrain (e.g., mist, darkness). Additionally, you can faintly perceive spectral entities within 15 feet (3 squares) without a skill check, though details require an Observation roll.

**Drawback:** The Spectral Realm's influence frays your connection to reality; you gain 1 Soul Drain whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene.

**Narrative Flavor:** The veil between realms thins for you, allowing you to move like a ghost but at the cost of your mental stability. You may hear faint, mocking laughter or see shadowy figures in your peripheral vision. This perk aligns with Wraith or Shadowmancer themes.

#### Corrupted Surge

**Effect (Active):** Once per short rest, as a Bonus Action, you can take 1 Soul Drain to add +2 damage to your next successful weapon or spell attack this turn.

**Drawback:** After using this ability, your connection to Nosgoth's balance weakens; you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects until you complete a short rest.

**Narrative Flavor:** You channel the raw, chaotic energy of corruption into a devastating strike, your weapon or spell glowing with an eerie, sickly hue. Your body trembles afterward, and you feel a lingering coldness, as if the Pillars themselves reject you. This perk offers a high-risk, high-reward option for any class.

### Tier 2 Corrupted Perks (Corruption Level 7-10)

#### Veil of the Damned

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per short rest, you summon a 10-foot (2 squares) radius cloud of spectral mist centered on yourself, lasting 1 minute. The area is lightly obscured, granting +1 die to your Stealth checks and imposing a -1 die penalty on enemies' Observation checks within or targeting the area. You can see normally within the mist. Costs 1 Soul Energy (SE).

**Drawback:** The mist clings to you unnaturally; until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects, as the mist marks you as tainted.

**Narrative Flavor:** You call forth a shroud of souls from the Spectral Realm, their whispers cloaking you in shadow. Your skin takes on a pallid, corpse-like hue, and allies may hear faint cries emanating from you. GMs can use this to hint at the Elder God's awareness or attract spectral entities.

#### Hunger's Blade

**Effect (Passive):** When you deal damage with a melee weapon attack to a living creature with blood, you regain 2 HP, up to once per turn. If the target is bleeding (e.g., from a Sangromancer's Hemorrhage), the healing increases to 4 HP.

**Drawback:** Your hunger intensifies; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save each scene to avoid attacking or feeding on a bleeding ally within 10 feet (2 squares). Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for 1 round.

**Narrative Flavor:** Your weapon pulses with a sickly red glow, drinking deeply from your foes. Your fangs lengthen, and your eyes glint with predatory need, alarming even your allies. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust while offering sustain.

#### Hylden's Grasp

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per scene, you conjure a glyph of Hylden energy at a point within 30 feet (6 squares). Enemies within a 5-foot (1 square) radius must make a DR 2 Might or Evasion save (their choice). On a failure, they are Rooted for 1 round and take 2 Corruption damage. Costs 2 Soul Energy.

**Drawback:** Using this ability adds 1 Corruption Point to your total, and you suffer 1 Soul Drain as Hylden whispers invade your mind.

**Narrative Flavor:** You channel the banished Hylden's entropy, your hands glowing with sickly green sigils. Your voice occasionally carries an alien timbre, and you dream of a desolate, glyph-scarred wasteland. GMs may use this to foreshadow Hylden incursions or faction suspicion.

#### Soul Leech

**Effect (Active):** As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can target a creature within 15 feet (3 squares) that you've damaged this turn. They must make a DR 2 Will save or take 3 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you regain 1 Soul Energy (SE).

**Drawback:** Your soul becomes tainted; until your next long rest, any healing you receive from non-corrupted sources (e.g., holy magic or Balance Wardens) is reduced by 2 HP.

**Narrative Flavor:** You siphon a fragment of your foe's essence, your eyes glowing with stolen light. Your shadow flickers unnaturally, as if alive, and you feel a gnawing emptiness within. This perk aligns with Soul Reavers or Hylden Warlocks, emphasizing soul manipulation.

#### Abyssal Echo

**Effect (Reactive):** Once per scene, when you fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can use your Reaction to reroll the save with +1 die. If you succeed, the caster takes 2 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances). Costs 1 Soul Drain.

**Drawback:** The Abyss's touch lingers; you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight checks until your next short rest, as reality feels distorted.

**Narrative Flavor:** You deflect magic with a ripple of void energy, your form briefly glitching like a broken tapestry. Your reflection shows a stranger's face, and you hear faint, mocking laughter. This perk suits Unbound or Hylden characters, tying to their resistance to fate.

#### Corrupted Ferocity

**Effect (Active):** As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can enter a frenzied state for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +3 damage, but you take 1 physical damage (bypassing Armor) each time you attack. Costs 2 Soul Drain.

**Drawback:** After the frenzy ends, you're exhausted, suffering a -1 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a short rest.

**Narrative Flavor:** You unleash a torrent of corrupted rage, your body sprouting jagged, bone-like protrusions. Your laughter grows unhinged, and allies may fear you're losing control. This perk fits Blood Knights or Turelim, enhancing their combat prowess at a steep cost.

### Tier 3 Corrupted Perks (Corruption Level 11-15)

#### Soulrend Dominion

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per long rest, you unleash a wave of soul-devouring energy in a 15-foot (3 squares) radius centered on yourself. Enemies in the area must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 6 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and are Frightened for 1 minute (repeat save at end of each turn). On a success, they take 3 Soul damage. You regain 1 Soul Energy (SE) per affected enemy. Costs 3 SE and 2 Soul Drain.

**Drawback:** Your soul frays; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and until your next long rest, you suffer a -2 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects. Additionally, spectral entities are drawn to you, increasing the chance of hostile encounters (GM discretion).

**Narrative Flavor:** You tear at the essence of your foes, your form wreathed in spectral fire. Your eyes burn with an unnatural void, and your voice echoes with a chorus of trapped souls. Allies may fear you're becoming a conduit for the Elder God. GMs can use this to introduce spectral pursuers or visions of the Wheel of Fate.

#### Bloodforged Apotheosis

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per short rest, you transform into a blood-wrought avatar for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +4 damage (Blood damage, bypassing physical Armor), and you gain 5 Temporary HP at the start of each of your turns. Costs 2 Blood Points (BP) and 1 Corruption Point.

**Drawback:** Your body warps permanently (e.g., crimson veins pulse visibly, or bone spurs protrude); you suffer a -2 die penalty on Persuasion checks with uncorrupted NPCs (e.g., Sarafan, Nomads). After the effect ends, you take 4 physical damage (bypassing Armor) from overexertion.

**Narrative Flavor:** Your blood boils, reshaping you into a living weapon. Your laughter is guttural, and your presence terrifies mortals. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust but marking them as monstrous. GMs may have factions hunt you as a threat.

#### Hylden's Rift

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per long rest, you tear open a rift to the Hylden's banished dimension at a point within 60 feet (12 squares), creating a 10-foot (2 squares) radius zone of chaotic energy for 1 minute. Enemies entering or starting their turn in the zone take 4 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances) and must make a DR 3 Might save or be slowed (half speed) for 1 round. Costs 4 SE and 3 Soul Drain.

**Drawback:** The rift destabilizes you; you gain 2 Corruption Points, and your maximum HP is reduced by 5 until you complete a long rest. The rift may attract Hylden attention, potentially summoning a minor Hylden entity (GM discretion).

**Narrative Flavor:** You channel the Hylden's entropy, your hands glowing with otherworldly sigils. Your dreams are plagued by visions of a shattered realm, and your shadow writhes independently. This perk aligns with Hylden Warlocks, risking cosmic consequences for immense power.

#### Abyssal Pact

**Effect (Active):** As a Bonus Action, once per scene, you can sacrifice 5 HP to gain +2 dice on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saves for 1 minute. If you reduce an enemy to 0 HP during this time, you regain 3 HP and 1 SE.

**Drawback:** The pact binds you to the Abyss; you gain 1 Corruption Point each time you use this ability, and until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight and Concentration checks as abyssal whispers cloud your mind.

**Narrative Flavor:** You offer your vitality to an unseen force, your wounds weeping black ichor. Your movements are unnaturally fluid, but your gaze grows distant, as if listening to a voice only you hear. This perk suits Blood Knights or Unbound, offering versatility at a steep cost. GMs can hint at an abyssal entity taking interest.

#### Wraith's Lament

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per short rest, you emit a keening wail that affects all enemies within 30 feet (6 squares). Targets must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 5 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and cannot take Reactions until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take 2 Soul damage. Costs 2 SE and 2 Soul Drain.

**Drawback:** Your connection to the Spectral Realm deepens; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and you suffer 1 Soul Drain whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene until your next long rest.

**Narrative Flavor:** Your wail echoes with the sorrow of lost souls, your form flickering like a dying flame. Your touch grows cold, and mirrors show a gaunt, spectral version of you. This perk fits Wraiths or Shadowmancers, enhancing their spectral prowess but binding them to the Spectral Realm's torment.

#### Corrupted Ascension

**Effect (Active):** As an Action, once per long rest, you ascend into a corrupted state for 1 minute. You gain a fly speed equal to your movement speed, your attacks deal +3 Corruption damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you ignore difficult terrain. Costs 3 BP or 3 SE and 2 Corruption Points.

**Drawback:** Your body mutates (e.g., wings of shadow, glowing veins); you suffer a -2 die penalty on all social skill checks with non-corrupted NPCs permanently. After the effect ends, you're exhausted, suffering a -2 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a long rest.

**Narrative Flavor:** You rise on currents of corrupted energy, your form a blasphemy against Nosgoth's balance. Your voice carries an otherworldly resonance, and the Pillars seem to shudder in your presence. This perk suits any class, offering mobility and offense but marking you as an outcast. GMs may have the Sarafan or Balance Wardens target you.
