# Chapter 9: Combat and Damage Types in Nosgoth
In the cursed land of Nosgoth, combat is a brutal dance of blood and shadow, where steel clashes with sorcery, and the veil between Material and Spectral realms quivers. Whether wielding a reaver blade, weaving glyphs of decay, or phasing through realms to strike from the unseen, every action carries weight—and a price. This chapter combines the rules for combat with the diverse damage types that define Nosgoth’s conflicts, using the D6 dice success system to resolve attacks, defenses, and special maneuvers. Prepare to face the consequences of power in a world where survival demands sacrifice.

## 9.1 Combat Overview

Combat in *Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG* is structured into rounds, each representing 6–10 seconds of chaotic, high-stakes action. Within each round, combatants act in initiative order, weaving a tapestry of strikes, spells, and tactical decisions. A combatant’s turn consists of:

- **1 Action**: Attack, cast a spell, use an ability, or perform another significant task.
- **1 Movement**: Move up to your Speed stat (in tiles, typically 5 feet per tile).
- **1 Reaction**: Respond to a trigger (e.g., an attack or enemy movement) once per round.
- **Free Interactions**: Minor actions like drawing a weapon, speaking, or dropping an item.

Combat is visceral yet strategic, encouraging players to leverage terrain, realm-shifting, and creative use of successes to outmaneuver foes. The Game Master (GM) ensures the tone remains dark and cinematic, adjudicating outcomes to reflect Nosgoth’s unforgiving nature.

## 9.2 Initiative

Combat begins with determining who acts first, reflecting the razor-sharp instincts required to survive Nosgoth’s dangers.

- **Roll Initiative**: Each combatant rolls a dice pool equal to their Shadow + Tactics or Shadow + Concentration (player’s choice). Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success.
- **Order**: The combatant with the highest number of successes acts first. Ties are broken by the highest Shadow stat, then by GM discretion (e.g., narrative context or environmental factors).
- **Example**: Kain (Shadow 4, Tactics 2) rolls 6 dice, scoring 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (2 successes). A Sarafan knight (Shadow 3, Tactics 3) rolls 6 dice, scoring 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (3 successes). The knight acts first.

## 9.3 Actions: Attacking

To strike an enemy, whether with claw, blade, or spell, follow these steps:

- **Declare Target and Roll**: Roll a dice pool equal to the relevant Attribute + Skill (e.g., Fury + Weapon Mastery for a melee attack, Shadow + Weapon Mastery for a finesse-based attack, or Soul + Glyphcasting for spells).
- **Count Successes**: Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success.
- **Compare to Defense Value (DV)**: The target’s DV is the number of successes required to hit. DV is typically 1 + (higher of Shadow or Will), modified by armor, perks, or effects (e.g., “Nosgothian Chainmail +2 DV”).
- **Resolve Hit**: If successes meet or exceed the DV, the attack hits. Deal damage based on the weapon or ability, reduced by the target’s armor (unless bypassed by damage type). Extra successes (beyond DV) can enhance the attack (see Section 9.6).

**Example**: Raziel (Fury 3, Weapon Mastery 4) attacks a vampire hunter (DV 2, Armor 1) with a reaver blade (Slashing, 3 damage). He rolls 7 dice, getting 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (3 successes). The attack hits (3 ≥ 2), dealing 3 damage minus Armor 1 = 2 damage. The extra success can add +1 damage (total 3) or inflict Bleeding (1 damage for 2 rounds).

## 9.4 Defense and Armor

Surviving Nosgoth’s battlefields requires cunning defense and resilience.

While skill checks are made against a static DR, attacks in combat are resolved by comparing your successes against your opponent's **Defense Value (DV)**. A character's DV is a dynamic score that reflects their innate evasiveness, armor, and training, making them a much harder target than a simple locked door.

- **Defense Value (DV)**: A passive score (1 + higher of Shadow or Will, plus modifiers) that attackers must meet or exceed to hit. For example, a vampire with Shadow 3 and Nosgothian Chainmail (+2 DV) has DV 6.
- **Armor**: Reduces incoming physical damage (Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing) by a flat amount (e.g., 1–3, depending on gear). For example, Leather Armor reduces damage by 1, while Sarafan Plate reduces by 3. Some damage types (e.g., Soul, Soulfire, Void) ignore armor entirely.
- **Active Defense**: Characters can use their Reaction (see Section 9.8) to actively defend with skills like Shadow + Evasion (Dodge) or Fury + Weapon Mastery (Parry).

## 9.5 Damage and Health

Damage reflects the toll of Nosgoth’s brutal conflicts, from claw slashes to soul-rending glyphs.

- **Damage Calculation**: Based on the weapon or ability (e.g., Reaver Blade: 3 Slashing damage, Fire Glyph: 4 Fire damage). Subtract the target’s armor from physical damage types; other types may bypass armor or have unique effects (see Section 9.6).
- **Health Points (HP)**: Tracks physical endurance. At 0 HP, a character falls unconscious or begins dying (GM discretion, based on narrative).
- **Wounds and Sanity Loss**: Some attacks (e.g., cursed weapons, Soul or Corruption damage) inflict Wounds (lasting injuries) or Sanity Loss (mental strain), detailed in the Character Creation Guide.
- **Healing**: Limited in Nosgoth, often requiring blood consumption (for vampires), glyphs, or rare artifacts. Some damage types (e.g., Void, Soulfire) may resist conventional healing.

**Example**: A Dumahim vampire (HP 10, Armor 2) takes 5 Piercing damage from a spear (ignores 1 Armor). After Armor, 4 damage is applied (5 – 1 = 4), reducing HP to 6.

## 9.6 Extra Successes: Enhancing Actions

Nosgoth’s warriors turn success into dominance. Extra successes (beyond those needed to meet DV or DR) allow enhanced outcomes, tailored to the damage type.

### In Combat:
- **+1 Damage**: Add 1 damage per extra success (up to weapon or GM limit).
- **Status Effects**:
  - **Physical**: *Staggered* (cannot take Reactions) or *Bleeding* (1 damage/round for 2 rounds).
  - **Elemental**: *Slowed* (movement halved) or *Shocked* (disadvantage on attacks).
  - **Force**: *Prone* (target falls) or *Pushed* (moved 5-10 ft).
  - **Spectral**: *Soul Drain* (target loses 1 Soul Energy, attacker gains 1).
  - **Radiant**: *Blinded* (disadvantage on attacks/perception) or *Purged* (ends 1 shadowy effect).
  - **Entropic**: *Decay* (target cannot heal HP this round) or *Corrupted* (adds 1 Corruption Point).
- **Multi-Target Strike**: Hit additional targets (GM discretion for area or sweeping attacks).
- **Bypass Armor**: Ignore 1 point of armor per extra success (if applicable).

### Outside Combat:
- Perform actions with precision or flair (e.g., silent lockpicking).
- Complete tasks faster or stealthily.
- Gain narrative advantages (e.g., repositioning, uncovering hidden lore).
- Create stunts (e.g., leaping to a chandelier, grabbing a relic mid-fight).

**Example**: Kain rolls 5 successes against a foe with DV 2 using a Spectral attack. With 3 extra successes, he could deal +3 damage, inflict Soul Drain, or bypass 3 points of armor.

The GM adjudicates extra success outcomes, balancing player creativity with narrative coherence. Players are encouraged to propose flavorful effects tied to damage types.

## 9.7 Damage Types and Effects

Nosgoth’s conflicts are shaped by diverse damage types, consolidated into six categories to reflect the supernatural and physical forces at play.

### 9.7.1 Physical Damage
- **Includes**: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing.
- **Definition**: Mundane trauma from weapons, claws, or falling debris.

### Damage Type Summary Table

| Damage Type      | Key Property                                  | Common Status Effect on Extra Success |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Physical**     | Reduced by Armor                              | Bleeding, Staggered                   |
| **Elemental**    | Halves Armor                                  | Burning, Slowed, Shocked              |
| **Force**        | Bypasses Armor                                | Prone, Pushed                         |
| **Spectral**     | Ignores Physical Armor; Hits Spectral foes    | Soul Drain                            |
| **Radiant**      | Double Dmg vs Undead/Spectral                 | Blinded, Purged                       |
| **Entropic**     | Prevents Heating; Adds Corruption             | Decay, Corrupted                      |

## 9.8 Reactions

Reactions are swift, instinctive responses that turn defense into opportunity, usable once per round on another creature’s turn.

- **Mechanics**:
  - Triggered by specific events (e.g., being attacked, enemy movement).
  - Require a skill check or specific ability (e.g., Shadow + Evasion for Dodge).
  - Must be declared before damage is applied (for defensive reactions).
- **Common Reactions**:
  - **Dodge** (Shadow + Evasion): Avoid a melee or ranged attack.
  - **Parry** (Fury + Weapon Mastery): Reduce melee damage with a weapon or shield.
  - **Counterspell** (Soul + Glyphcasting or Forbidden Knowledge): Negate a magical effect targeting you.
  - **Opportunity Attack**: Strike a foe entering or leaving your melee range.
  - **Spectral Shift**: Phase between Material and Spectral realms (requires specific trait or spell).
- **Reaction Rolls**: Roll Attribute + Skill. Successes reduce damage or effects:
  - 1 Success: Reduce damage by 1.
  - 2 Successes: Reduce damage by 2 or negate a status effect.
  - 3+ Successes: Halve damage or fully evade (GM discretion).
- **Rules Notes**:
  - You must be conscious and able to act.
  - A failed reaction expends your reaction for the round.
  - Perks or gear may grant additional reactions (see Character Creation Guide).

**Example**: A Turelim warrior is hit by a Fire Glyph (4 Fire damage, ignores armor). They use a Dodge reaction (Shadow 3 + Evasion 2), rolling 5 dice and getting 2 successes, reducing damage by 2 (to 2 damage total).

## 9.9 Advantage and Disadvantage

Situational factors can grant you **Advantage** or impose **Disadvantage** on a roll. This system gives you a second chance—either to turn failure into success, or to have your success snatched away by fate.

**Advantage (Re-roll Failures)**

When you have Advantage, roll your dice pool once. After the roll, you may **pick up any dice that failed (showing 4 or less) and re-roll them**. Add any new successes to your initial total. This gives you a chance to improve a mediocre outcome.

**Disadvantage (Re-roll Successes)**

When you have Disadvantage, roll your dice pool once. After the roll, you **must pick up any dice that succeeded (showing 5 or 6) and re-roll them**. Your final result is only the successes achieved on this second, mandatory roll. Any successes from your first roll are lost if they do not succeed again.

**Canceling**

If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage from different sources, they cancel each other out, and you simply roll your dice pool once as normal.

**Example**: Raziel attacks from a shadowfield (Advantage) but is Blinded by Radiant damage (Disadvantage). The effects cancel, and he rolls normally.

## 9.10 Special Actions

Nosgoth’s warriors wield powers beyond mortal limits, from soul-rending magic to realm-shifting maneuvers.

- **Spellcasting**: Roll Soul + Glyphcasting to cast spells, with successes determining effect strength (see Chapter 5: Magic and Glyphs). Damage types vary (e.g., Fire, Soul, Necrotic).
- **Grapples**: Roll Fury + Unarmed Combat to restrain, disarm, or knock prone (DR 2–3, GM discretion).
- **Shifting Realms**: Some abilities allow switching between Material and Spectral realms, granting tactical advantages (e.g., bypassing walls, attacking ethereal foes).
- **Pushing Rolls**: When you fail a roll, you may be able to push it by drawing on your inner Corruption. See Chapter 8: Corruption for the full mechanics.

## 9.11 Critical Hits and Failures

Exceptional skill or catastrophic missteps shape Nosgoth’s battles.

- **Critical Hit**: In combat, a Critical Hit is achieved by rolling **3 or more successes on an attack** or **exceeding the target's DV by 2 or more**. This represents a perfectly placed strike or a surge of power, granting one of the following benefits:
  - **Bonus Damage**: Deal extra damage (e.g., +2, or the weapon's base damage again).
  - **Potent Effect**: Apply a powerful status effect associated with the damage type (e.g., *Stun* the target for one round).
  - **Bypass Armor**: The attack ignores all of the target's physical armor.
  - **GM's Discretion**: The GM may introduce a unique narrative outcome, such as dismembering a limb or destroying a held item.

- **Critical Failure**: A Critical Failure occurs when a player **pushes a roll** by using a Corruption Die and the subsequent roll results in **0 successes** while the **Corruption Die shows a 1**. This triggers a dire consequence, such as a weapon breaking, a spell backfiring spectacularly, or a new, immediate threat appearing on the scene, as determined by the GM.

**Example**: A Melchahim claws at a foe (DV 3) with Necrotic damage, rolling 5 successes (critical hit). The GM allows +2 damage and Weakened (–2 damage on target’s next attack).

## 9.12 Environmental Combat

Nosgoth’s battlefields are as deadly as its warriors, with shifting realms and cursed terrain.

- **Material and Spectral Realms**: Characters with realm-shifting abilities can interact with both planes, gaining tactical edges (e.g., attacking through Spectral rifts).
- **Glyph Traps and Shadowfields**: Environmental hazards (e.g., traps dealing 2 Fire or Necrotic damage, fields granting advantage) challenge combatants. Roll Soul + Forbidden Knowledge or Craft to disarm or manipulate.
- **Terrain Interaction**: Use Fury + Strength or Craft to destroy objects (e.g., crumbling pillars, DR 2) or create cover.

**Example**: A Zephonim ambushes from a Spectral shadowfield (+2 advantage) and triggers a Fire Glyph trap (DR 2 to avoid, 2 Fire damage), forcing enemies to adapt or suffer.

## 9.13 Combat Example

**Setup**: Kain (Fury 4, Weapon Mastery 3, HP 12, DV 4, Armor 2) faces a Sarafan knight (DV 3, Armor 2, HP 10) on a cursed altar (+1 disadvantage to Kain).

- **Initiative**: Kain rolls Shadow 3 + Tactics 2 (5 dice: 2 successes). The knight rolls 3 successes, acting first.
- **Knight’s Turn**: Rolls Fury 3 + Weapon Mastery 4 (7 dice, –1 highest die for disadvantage) for a Piercing attack (spear, 3 damage, ignores 1 Armor). Results: 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1. Remove 6, leaving 2 successes. Misses Kain’s DV 4.
- **Kain’s Turn**: Attacks with a Soulfire Reaver Blade (7 dice, –1 for disadvantage, 3 Soulfire damage, ignores armor). Results: 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Remove 6, leaving 3 successes (hits DV 3). Deals 3 Soulfire damage (knight HP 7) and uses 1 extra success to inflict Blighted (no natural healing for 1 round).
- **Knight’s Reaction**: Parries (Fury + Weapon Mastery, 2 successes), reducing damage by 2 (to 1 damage, knight HP 9). Blighted remains.
- **Next Round**: Knight cannot heal naturally due to Blighted and acts with reduced effectiveness.

**Narrative**: Kain’s Soulfire blade sears the knight’s essence, the altar’s curse hampering his strike. The Sarafan’s shield mitigates the blow, but the unnatural flame lingers, weakening their resolve.

## 9.14 GM Guidance

- **Balancing Encounters**: Set DV and HP to challenge but not overwhelm. A DV 3–5 foe suits most parties; DR 4+ tasks should be rare and climactic. Consider damage type resistances (e.g., undead immune to Necrotic).
- **Cinematic Descriptions**: Describe extra successes vividly (e.g., “Your Soulfire blade erupts, charring their soul as they stagger”). Tailor to damage types for flavor.
- **Environmental Depth**: Use Nosgoth’s terrain (e.g., blood fountains, Spectral rifts, Void-tainted zones) to reward clever tactics and reflect damage type hazards.
- **Corruption Risks**: Emphasize the cost of pushing rolls, tying failures to Nosgoth’s dark themes (e.g., a critical failure with Corruption damage summons a spectral wraith).

Combat in Nosgoth is a crucible of power and peril, shaped by the interplay of physical, magical, and esoteric damage types. Whether you fight as a vampire lord, a Sarafan zealot, or a realm-shifting wraith, every strike—and every wound—shapes your fate and the cursed world around you.
