Chapter 9: Combat in Nosgoth
In the cursed land of Nosgoth, combat is a brutal dance of blood and shadow, where steel clashes with sorcery, and the veil between Material and Spectral realms quivers. Whether wielding a reaver blade, weaving glyphs of decay, or phasing through realms to strike from the unseen, every action carries weight—and a price. This chapter outlines the rules for combat, using the D6 dice success system to resolve attacks, defenses, and special maneuvers. Prepare to face the consequences of power in a world where survival demands sacrifice.

9.1 Combat Overview
Combat in Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG is structured into rounds, each representing 6–10 seconds of chaotic, high-stakes action. Within each round, combatants act in initiative order, weaving a tapestry of strikes, spells, and tactical decisions. A combatant’s turn consists of:

1 Action: Attack, cast a spell, use an ability, or perform another significant task.
1 Movement: Move up to your Speed stat (in tiles, typically 5 feet per tile).
1 Reaction: Respond to a trigger (e.g., an attack or enemy movement) once per round.
Free Interactions: Minor actions like drawing a weapon, speaking, or dropping an item.

Combat is visceral yet strategic, encouraging players to leverage terrain, realm-shifting, and creative use of successes to outmaneuver foes. The Game Master (GM) ensures the tone remains dark and cinematic, adjudicating outcomes to reflect Nosgoth’s unforgiving nature.


9.2 Initiative
Combat begins with determining who acts first, reflecting the razor-sharp instincts required to survive Nosgoth’s dangers.

Roll Initiative: Each combatant rolls a dice pool equal to their Shadow + Tactics or Shadow + Concentration (player’s choice). Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success.
Order: The combatant with the highest number of successes acts first. Ties are broken by the highest Shadow stat, then by GM discretion (e.g., narrative context or environmental factors).
Example: Kain (Shadow 4, Tactics 2) rolls 6 dice, scoring 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (2 successes). A Sarafan knight (Shadow 3, Tactics 3) rolls 6 dice, scoring 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (3 successes). The knight acts first.

9.3 Actions: Attacking
To strike an enemy, whether with claw, blade, or spell, follow these steps:

Declare Target and Roll: Roll a dice pool equal to the relevant Attribute + Skill (e.g., Fury + Weapon Mastery for a melee attack, Shadow + Weapon Mastery for a finesse-based attack, or Soul + Glyphcasting for spells).
Count Successes: Each die showing a 5 or 6 counts as one success.
Compare to Defense Value (DV): The target’s DV is the number of successes required to hit. DV is typically 1 + (higher of Shadow or Will), modified by armor, perks, or effects (e.g., “Nosgothian Chainmail +2 DV”).
Resolve Hit: If successes meet or exceed the DV, the attack hits. Deal damage based on the weapon or ability, reduced by the target’s armor. Extra successes (beyond DV) can enhance the attack (see Section 3.6).

Example: Raziel (Fury 3, Weapon Mastery 4) attacks a vampire hunter (DV 2, Armor 1) with a reaver blade. He rolls 7 dice, getting 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (3 successes). The attack hits (3 ≥ 2), dealing base damage (e.g., 3) minus Armor 1 = 2 damage. The extra success (1 beyond DV) can add +1 damage (total 3) or inflict a status effect like Bleeding.

9.4 Defense and Armor
Surviving Nosgoth’s battlefields requires cunning defense and resilience.

Defense Value (DV): A passive score (1 + higher of Shadow or Will, plus modifiers) that attackers must meet or exceed to hit. For example, a vampire with Shadow 3 and Nosgothian Chainmail (+2 DV) has DV 6.
Armor: Reduces incoming damage by a flat amount (e.g., 1–3, depending on gear). For example, Leather Armor reduces damage by 1, while Sarafan Plate reduces by 3.
Active Defense: Characters can use their Reaction (see Section 3.7) to actively defend with skills like Shadow + Evasion (Dodge) or Fury + Weapon Mastery (Parry).

9.5 Damage and Health
Damage reflects the toll of Nosgoth’s brutal conflicts, from claw slashes to soul-rending glyphs.

Damage Calculation: Based on the weapon or ability (e.g., Reaver Blade: 3 damage, Fire Glyph: 4 damage). Subtract the target’s armor from the total.
Health Points (HP): Tracks physical endurance. At 0 HP, a character falls unconscious or begins dying (GM discretion, based on narrative).
Wounds and Sanity Loss: Some attacks (e.g., cursed weapons, soul magic) inflict Wounds (lasting injuries) or Sanity Loss (mental strain), detailed in the Character Creation Guide.
Healing: Limited in Nosgoth, often requiring blood consumption (for vampires), glyphs, or rare artifacts.

Example: A Dumahim vampire (HP 10, Armor 2) takes 5 damage from a spear. After Armor, 3 damage is applied (5 – 2 = 3), reducing HP to 7.

9.6 Extra Successes: Enhancing Actions
Nosgoth’s warriors turn success into dominance. Extra successes (beyond those needed to meet DV or DR) allow enhanced outcomes, especially in combat.

In Combat:
+1 Damage: Add 1 damage per extra success (up to weapon or GM limit).
Status Effects: Choose one (GM approval may be required for context):
Staggered: Target cannot take Reactions until the end of their next turn.
Prone: Target falls; must spend movement to stand.
Disarmed: Target drops their weapon or item.
Bleeding: Target takes 1 damage at the start of their turn for 2 rounds.
Blinded: Target suffers disadvantage on attacks and perception checks.
Silenced: Target cannot cast spells with verbal components.
Grappled: Target is immobilized until they succeed on a DR 2 Fury check.
Weakened: Target deals -2 damage on their next attack.
Marked: Target takes +1 damage from your allies’ attacks.
Slowed: Target’s movement is halved for 1 round.


Multi-Target Strike: Hit additional targets (GM discretion for area or sweeping attacks).
Bypass Armor: Ignore 1 point of armor per extra success.


Outside Combat:
Perform actions with precision or flair (e.g., silent lockpicking).
Complete tasks faster or stealthily.
Gain narrative advantages (e.g., repositioning, uncovering hidden lore).
Create stunts (e.g., leaping to a chandelier, grabbing a relic mid-fight).



Example: Kain rolls 5 successes against a foe with DV 2. With 3 extra successes, he could deal +3 damage, inflict Bleeding and Staggered, or bypass 3 points of armor.
The GM adjudicates extra success outcomes, balancing player creativity with narrative coherence. Players are encouraged to propose flavorful effects, but the GM ensures feasibility.

9.7 Reactions
Reactions are swift, instinctive responses that turn defense into opportunity, usable once per round on another creature’s turn.

Mechanics:
Triggered by specific events (e.g., being attacked, an enemy moving nearby).
Require a skill check or specific ability (e.g., Shadow + Evasion for Dodge).
Must be declared before damage is applied (for defensive reactions).


Common Reactions:
Dodge (Shadow + Evasion): Avoid a melee or ranged attack.
Parry (Fury + Weapon Mastery): Reduce melee damage with a weapon or shield.
Counterspell (Soul + Glyphcasting or Forbidden Knowledge): Negate a magical effect targeting you.
Opportunity Attack: Strike a foe entering or leaving your melee range.
Spectral Shift: Phase between Material and Spectral realms (requires specific trait or spell).


Reaction Rolls: When defending, roll Attribute + Skill. Successes reduce damage or effects:
1 Success: Reduce damage by 1.
2 Successes: Reduce damage by 2 or negate a status effect.
3+ Successes: Halve damage or fully evade (GM discretion).


Rules Notes:
You must be conscious and able to act.
A failed reaction still expends your reaction for the round.
Perks or gear may grant additional reactions (see Character Creation Guide).



Example: A Turelim warrior is hit by a glyph (4 damage). They use a Dodge reaction (Shadow 3 + Evasion 2), rolling 5 dice and getting 2 successes. This reduces damage by 2 (to 2 damage total).

9.8 Advantage and Disadvantage
Combat in Nosgoth is shaped by terrain, preparation, and supernatural forces.

Modifiers:
Minor (±1 die): Slight terrain edge, brief distraction, low cover.
Moderate (±2 dice): High ground, magical assistance, blinding light.
Major (±3 dice): Perfect ambush, unaware target, cursed/incapacitated foe.


Advantage: Add bonus dice to your pool before rolling (max +3).
Disadvantage: After rolling, remove the highest dice equal to the penalty (e.g., -2 removes two highest).
Canceling: Advantage and disadvantage cancel 1-for-1 (e.g., +2 and -1 = +1).

Example: Raziel attacks from a shadowfield (+2 advantage) but is Blinded (-2 disadvantage). The effects cancel, and he rolls normally.


9.9 Special Actions
Nosgoth’s warriors wield powers beyond mortal limits, from soul-rending magic to realm-shifting maneuvers.

Spellcasting: Roll Soul + Glyphcasting to cast spells, with successes determining effect strength (see Chapter 5: Magic and Glyphs).
Grapples: Roll Fury + Unarmed Combat to restrain, disarm, or knock prone (DR set by GM, typically 2–3).
Shifting Realms: Some abilities allow switching between Material and Spectral realms, granting tactical advantages (e.g., bypassing walls, attacking ethereal foes).
Pushing Rolls: Reroll failures by adding a Corruption Die. If no successes are rolled and the Corruption Die shows a 1, a critical failure triggers a Corruption effect (see Chapter 6: Corruption and Sanity).

9.10 Critical Hits and Failures
Exceptional skill or catastrophic missteps shape Nosgoth’s battles.

Critical Hit: Roll 3+ successes on an attack or exceed DV by 2+. Effects may include:
Bonus damage (e.g., +2).
Stun (target loses next action, GM discretion).
Bypass all armor.


Critical Failure: Roll no successes on a pushed roll, and the Corruption Die shows a 1. Triggers a Corruption effect (e.g., soul drain, environmental backlash) or unintended consequence (e.g., weapon breaks, allies endangered).

Example: A Melchahim claws at a foe (DV 3), rolling 5 successes (critical hit). The GM allows the attack to deal +2 damage and knock the target prone.


9.11 Environmental Combat
Nosgoth’s battlefields are as deadly as its warriors, with shifting realms and cursed terrain.

Material and Spectral Realms: Characters with realm-shifting abilities can interact with both planes, gaining tactical edges (e.g., attacking through Spectral rifts).
Glyph Traps and Shadowfields: Environmental hazards (e.g., traps dealing 2 damage, fields granting advantage) challenge combatants. Roll Soul + Forbidden Knowledge or Craft to disarm or manipulate.
Terrain Interaction: Use Fury + Strength or Craft to destroy objects (e.g., crumbling pillars, DR 2) or create cover.

Example: A Zephonim ambushes from a Spectral shadowfield (+2 advantage) and triggers a glyph trap (DR 2 to avoid), forcing enemies to adapt or suffer.


9.12 Combat Example
Setup: Kain (Fury 4, Weapon Mastery 3, HP 12, DV 4, Armor 2) faces a Sarafan knight (DV 3, Armor 2, HP 10) on a cursed altar (+1 disadvantage to Kain).

Initiative: Kain rolls Shadow 3 + Tactics 2 (5 dice: 2 successes). The knight rolls 3 successes, acting first.
Knight’s Turn: Rolls Fury 3 + Weapon Mastery 4 (7 dice, -1 highest die for disadvantage). Results: 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1. Remove 6 (highest), leaving 2 successes. Misses Kain’s DV 4.
Kain’s Turn: Attacks with a reaver blade (7 dice, -1 for disadvantage). Results: 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Remove 6, leaving 3 successes (hits DV 3). Deals 3 damage – Armor 2 = 1 damage (knight HP 9). Kain uses 1 extra success to inflict Bleeding (1 damage for 2 rounds).
Knight’s Reaction: Parries (Fury + Weapon Mastery, 2 successes), reducing damage by 2 (negating Kain’s 1 damage).
Next Round: Knight takes 1 damage from Bleeding (HP 8) before acting.

Narrative: Kain’s blade grazes the knight, drawing blood that seeps unnaturally, but the Sarafan’s shield deflects the brunt. The altar’s curse hums, threatening further peril.

9.13 GM Guidance

Balancing Encounters: Set DV and HP to challenge but not overwhelm. A DV 3–5 foe suits most parties; DR 4+ tasks should be rare and climactic.
Cinematic Descriptions: Describe extra successes vividly (e.g., “Your blade cleaves through their guard, pinning them against a crumbling pillar”).
Environmental Depth: Use Nosgoth’s terrain (e.g., blood fountains, spectral rifts) to reward clever tactics.
Corruption Risks: Emphasize the cost of pushing rolls, tying failures to Nosgoth’s dark themes (e.g., a critical failure summons a spectral wraith).

Combat in Nosgoth is a crucible of power and peril. Whether you fight as a vampire lord, a Sarafan zealot, or a realm-shifting wraith, every strike shapes your fate—and the cursed world around you.
