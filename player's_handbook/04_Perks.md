# Chapter 4: Perks System
In the cursed land of Nosgoth, where blood and shadow weave destinies, power is a double-edged blade. The Perks System allows characters to transcend their class and lineage, forging unique identities through abilities that blend mechanical advantage with narrative weight. Universal Perks are available to all, enhancing combat, exploration, or lore interactions. Corrupted Perks, unlocked through dark pacts or forbidden knowledge, offer immense power at the cost of sanity, body, and soul. This chapter details perk selection, progression, and the perilous path of corruption, guiding players and Game Masters (GMs) through Nosgoth’s treacherous landscape.
## Perk Progression
Perks define a character’s growth, reflecting their triumphs, struggles, and temptations. Characters gain Class Perks and Universal Perks as they level, with humans receiving additional perks via their racial trait. Perks are permanent once chosen, representing a commitment to a character’s path.
## Class Perks

Frequency: One Class Perk per level (1–20).
Selection: Chosen from the character’s specific Class Perk list, corresponding to their current level (e.g., a Blood Knight at Level 5 selects their Level 5 perk, such as Crushing Blow).
Purpose: These define core class identity, offering specialized abilities tied to the character’s role (e.g., combat, magic, or stealth).

## Universal Perks

Frequency: One Universal Perk slot at Levels 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 20.
Tier Progression:
Tier 1 (Levels 1–5): Foundational perks, accessible immediately.
Tier 2 (Levels 6–10): Requires one Tier 1 Universal Perk. Players may choose a Tier 2 perk or a lower-tier perk.
Tier 3 (Levels 11–15): Requires one Tier 2 Universal Perk. Players may choose a Tier 3 perk or a lower-tier perk.
Tier 4 (Levels 16–20): Requires one Tier 3 Universal Perk. Players may choose a Tier 4 perk or a lower-tier perk.


Human Racial Trait (Extra Perk): Humans gain one additional Universal Perk at Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, following the same tier unlock conditions (e.g., Level 4 grants a Tier 1 perk; Level 16 grants a Tier 4 or lower-tier perk).

## Corrupted Perks

Unlock Conditions: Available at Corruption Thresholds (3–6 for Tier 1, 7–10 for Tier 2, 11–15 for Tier 3) or through narrative triggers (e.g., soulbinding, Hylden pacts).
Selection: Chosen in place of a Universal Perk slot, subject to GM approval and narrative justification. No tier prerequisites apply within Corrupted Perks, but Corruption Score limits access.
Risks: Each carries drawbacks (e.g., Sanity loss, social penalties), reflecting Nosgoth’s theme of power at a cost.

## Multiclassing and Hybrid Perks

Eligibility: At Level 5+, players may request a Tier 1 perk from another class’s perk tree if narratively justified (e.g., a Blood Mage taking an Outcast stealth perk).
GM Oversight: Requires GM approval to ensure thematic fit and balance. Hybrid builds enable unique playstyles, such as a Sarafan Crusader with Scholar rituals.

## GM Optional Rule: Custom Perks
GMs may create unique perks tied to:

Character backstory (e.g., a vampire’s ancient lineage).
Critical story moments (e.g., surviving a Hylden encounter).
Regional or relic-based training (e.g., Blade of the Broken Circle: +3 damage vs. former allies, once per session).Custom perks should balance mechanical impact with narrative significance, matching the power level of equivalent Universal or Corrupted Perks.

## Universal Perks
Universal Perks enhance characters across all classes and lineages, offering tactical versatility and narrative depth. They are tiered to reflect growing power and influence in Nosgoth’s brutal world.

Corrupted Perks
Corrupted Perks tempt characters with forbidden power, unlocked through a Corruption Threshold or narrative events (e.g., soulbinding, Hylden pacts). They offer unmatched strength but erode mind, body, and social standing.
Corruption Threshold Mechanics
The Corruption Threshold measures a character’s descent into darkness, tracked by a Corruption Score (0–15). Each session, roll 2 × Corruption Level d6; failing a GM-set DC (e.g., 10) inflicts penalties (e.g., Sanity loss, narrative complications). Pushing rolls adds (Corruption Level / 3, rounded up) d6 per push, risking further failure.

Purification of Corruption
Corruption is not eternal. Characters may seek purification through perilous means, each woven into Nosgoth’s lore. Success reduces Corruption Score, but failure risks deeper taint.
1. Rituals of Purification
Ancient rites cleanse corruption but require rare components (e.g., Pillar dust, untainted blood) and specific locations (e.g., holy sites).  

Mechanics: Takes hours/days; requires Soul + Rituals or Will + Concentration checks (DR 3–4). Costs resources (e.g., 2 SE, 1 BP). Failure increases Corruption by 1 or inflicts Sanity damage.  
Narrative: Forms a story arc, with party members defending the ritualist from spectral or demonic threats.

2. Acts of Atonement or Defiance
Significant narrative acts (e.g., protecting a village, destroying a Hylden artifact) reduce Corruption.  

Mechanics: GM-adjudicated; requires challenging quests with skill checks (e.g., Might, Will). Success reduces Corruption by 1–3.  
Narrative: Reflects personal redemption, potentially shifting alliances or creating enemies.

3. Aid from Unique NPCs or Entities
Seek help from ancient vampires, Wardens of Balance, or spectral entities.  

Mechanics: Requires research (History/Forbidden Knowledge, DR 2–3) to find the entity, plus a service or sacrifice. Cleansing involves endurance checks (Will + Concentration, DR 3). Partial cleansing may impose obligations.  
Narrative: Leads to quests and moral dilemmas, with potential side effects (e.g., Warden debts).

4. Downtime Activities & Contemplation
Introspective practices during weeks/months of downtime reduce Corruption slightly.  

Mechanics: Requires Will + Concentration, Soul + Religion, or Forbidden Knowledge checks (DR 2–3). Success reduces Corruption by 1 or grants +1 die vs. Corruption effects.  
Narrative: Emphasizes internal struggle, with GM vignettes of inner demons or resolve.

GM Guidance

Balancing Perks: Cap total Universal Perks at 12 (including human bonuses) to prevent overload. Ensure Corrupted Perks’ drawbacks impact gameplay (e.g., social penalties trigger in key NPC interactions).
Narrative Hooks: Use hooks to drive story arcs (e.g., Hylden noticing Hylden’s Rift users). Custom perks should match tier power levels and include drawbacks.
Corruption Management: Track Corruption Score transparently; use environmental/social effects to reinforce its weight. Offer purification opportunities as campaign milestones.
Playtesting: Test perk synergies (e.g., Deathmark + Blood Vow) in varied encounters. Adjust costs (e.g., add Sanity to passives) if certain perks dominate.

Perks shape characters into legends or monsters, each choice a step toward power or ruin in Nosgoth’s eternal struggle. Choose wisely, for the Wheel turns ever onward.
