Universal Perks System

This document outlines the universal perk system used across all classes and lineages in the Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG. Players select perks at key milestone levels to expand their character‚Äôs identity beyond class roles, gaining access to broader narrative and mechanical benefits.

üéñ Universal Perk Selection
Players gain access to universal perks at:
Level 1-5 (Tier 1)
Level 6-10 (Tier 2)
Level 11-15 (Tier 3)
Level 16-20 (Tier 4)
Perks are unlocked in tiers and require at least one perk from the previous tier to advance.

üî∞ Tier 1 Perks (Levels 1-5)
Blood for Blood
Effect: Restore 1 HP when you score a critical hit.
Expansion: This perk provides a minor but immediate survivability boost for characters who land powerful blows in combat. In the dangerous world of Nosgoth, any amount of self-healing can be valuable, rewarding offensive success with a bit of resilience, which could be especially useful for frontline combatants.

Echo Sense
Effect: Detect hidden or invisible entities within 10 ft.
Expansion: Given Nosgoth's nature, with its Spectral Realm and creatures that might employ stealth (like Shadowmancers or Wraiths ), this perk offers a crucial early warning system. It enhances a character's awareness, potentially preventing ambushes or revealing unseen threats common in such a treacherous setting.

Iron Will
Effect: Reroll one failed Sanity save per scene.
Expansion: Sanity loss is a significant risk in Nosgoth, especially when dealing with Forbidden Spells, Corruption, or horrific entities like those from the Hylden. This perk provides a crucial lifeline, offering a second chance to resist mental strain and the madness that often accompanies power or terror in this world.

Glyph Mastery
Effect: Use glyphs even without class proficiency.
Expansion: Glyphs are a key part of Nosgoth's magic, used for traps and wards. This perk opens up tactical options for characters not inherently skilled in Glyphcasting (a primary skill for Glyph Seekers ), allowing them to interact with or perhaps even utilize simpler environmental glyphs they might encounter.

Shadow‚Äôs Edge
Effect: +1 to rolls made while in dim light or darkness.
Expansion: Nosgoth is a dark, gothic realm, meaning dim light and darkness are common conditions. This perk gives a tangible advantage to characters operating in these shadowed environments, benefiting stealthy approaches, ambushes, or any action taken where light is scarce.

Spirit Bond
Effect: Once long rest, commune with a ghost for insight.
Expansion: The Spectral Realm and its inhabitants (spirits, wraiths ) play a significant role in Nosgoth. This perk allows a character to directly seek information from these entities, potentially uncovering secrets, gaining warnings, or understanding past events in a world haunted by echoes.

Battle Meditation
Effect: Regain 1 HP after combat if no Sanity was lost.
Expansion: This perk rewards characters who can maintain their composure and avoid mental trauma during stressful combat encounters. It provides a small measure of recovery, encouraging tactical play that minimizes exposure to horrifying or corrupting elements, which are prevalent threats.

Tombborn
Effect: You may sense undead or cursed ground.
Expansion: Undead creatures and cursed locations are common dangers in a world like Nosgoth, heavily influenced by vampirism and cyclical destruction. This perk acts as an early warning system, allowing characters to better prepare for or avoid such blighted areas and their inhabitants.

Focused Ritualist
Effect: Gain +1 to glyphcasting if uninjured.
Expansion: For characters who dabble in or specialize in glyphs, this perk rewards careful positioning and avoiding damage. It enhances the effectiveness of their glyph-related actions when they can maintain a state of readiness, crucial for a magic system that involves precise inscription.

Death Watcher
Effect: Detect when an enemy drops below 25% HP.
Expansion: Knowing when a foe is critically wounded can be a significant tactical advantage, allowing a character or party to focus fire, attempt a finishing blow (like the Dreadblade's Death's Whisper perk), or assess threats more accurately in the brutal combat scenarios of Nosgoth.



‚öî Tier 2 Perks (Levels 6-10 )
Requires one Tier 1 universal perk.

Momentum Kill
Effect: Gain bonus movement after a kill.
Expansion: This perk rewards characters who can decisively eliminate foes, granting them tactical repositioning to either press the attack against remaining enemies or secure a more advantageous position. In a world where combat can be frequent and deadly, maintaining the initiative through such momentum can be crucial.

Phase Slip
Effect: Ignore difficult terrain in Spectral Realm.
Expansion: For characters who can access or are forced into the Spectral Realm (like Wraiths or Soul Reavers ), this perk significantly enhances their mobility. The Spectral Realm is described as having distorted physics and warped time, so navigating it efficiently is a key advantage.

Sanity Tap
Effect: Spend 1 Sanity to add +2 to a roll.
Expansion: This perk offers a high-risk, high-reward option, embodying the theme of power having a price. In critical moments, a character can channel their mental fortitude or perhaps touch upon dangerous insights to significantly boost their chance of success on any given roll, at the cost of their mental well-being ‚Äì a common peril in Nosgoth.

Void Walker
Effect: Immune to corrupted terrain hazards.
Expansion: Nosgoth is a fractured world rife with corruption, which can manifest as hazardous terrain. This perk allows characters to traverse such blighted areas unscathed, invaluable for exploring ancient ruins or confronting sources of decay without succumbing to their environmental toll.

Time Echo
Effect: Re-roll one Initiative roll per scene.
Expansion: Initiative determines the order of action in combat, which can be critical. This perk allows a character to manipulate this crucial aspect once per scene, potentially turning a poor initiative roll into a much better one, reflecting the themes of time manipulation and defying predetermined outcomes present in Nosgoth.

Soul Ward
Effect: Once long rest, absorb one source of damage.
Expansion: This provides a potent defensive measure, allowing a character to completely negate a single damaging attack or effect once long rest. In a world with powerful foes and devastating abilities, this can be a life-saving tool, representing a powerful personal ward against harm.

Spell Siphon
Effect: Steal 1 spell or ability from a foe once long rest.
Expansion: This remarkable perk allows a character to temporarily acquire an enemy's magical capability, offering incredible versatility and a way to turn an opponent's strength against them. It speaks to the volatile and often stolen nature of power in Nosgoth.

Spectral Fortitude
Effect: Gain +2 Defense in Spectral Realm.
Expansion: For characters who frequently operate or fight within the Spectral Realm, this perk significantly boosts their survivability by making them harder to hit in that specific plane of existence, where different rules and dangers apply.

Blood Alchemy
Effect: Convert HP into temporary Soul Energy.
Expansion: This perk allows characters to sacrifice their physical vitality (HP) for magical power (Soul Energy), reflecting the often costly nature of magic and the interconnectedness of life force and spiritual essence. It's particularly useful for casters needing a quick SE boost in a pinch.

Shadow Link
Effect: Teleport to a shadow within 10 ft as a bonus action.
Expansion: Granting short-range teleportation via shadows as a quick action provides significant tactical mobility. This is invaluable for stealthy characters like Shadowmancers or any character wishing to quickly reposition, engage, or disengage in Nosgoth's often dimly lit environments.


üïØ Tier 3 Perks (Levels 11-15)
Requires one Tier 2 universal perk.

Ascended Form ‚Äì Transform once per act into a powerful avatar.

Chrono Clarity ‚Äì Cannot be surprised; always act first.

üîπ Tier 4 Universal Perks (Levels 16 - 20)
	Require 1 Universal Tier 3 Perk
Power earned through blood, ruin, and the defiance of destiny. These perks are rare, mythic, and often whispered of in prophecy or madness. Only the most legendary figures of Nosgoth may claim them.

üßø Cyclebreaker‚Äôs Defiance
Prerequisite: None
 Effect: Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 HP, irreversibly corrupted, banished, or erased from existence, you may instead declare defiance. You are restored to 1 HP, all Corruption is cleansed, and you may immediately take a full turn (outside the normal initiative order). This breaks natural laws; you gain 1 permanent Corruption afterward.
 Narrative Hook: You have slipped the Wheel‚Äôs noose‚Äîagain. Something noticed.

‚è≥ Paradox Strike
Prerequisite: Must possess a time-, soul-, or phase-based ability
 Effect: Once per scene, when you hit with a melee or ranged attack, the wound echoes through time. At the start of the target‚Äôs next turn, they suffer the same damage again. This repeated damage bypasses resistances but not immunities.
 Narrative Hook: You do not simply strike flesh‚Äîyou strike the past.

üåò Spectral Anchor
Effect: You are now permanently tethered to the Spectral Realm.
You always perceive the Spectral Realm and entities within it.
You gain resistance to all Soul damage.
You cannot be forcibly moved by non-magical effects unless you allow it.
 Narrative Hook: You stand in two worlds. Neither can claim you fully.



ü©∏ Legacy Transfusion
Effect: Choose one Tier 2 or 3 Perk from any other class or lineage. You gain its effects permanently, including passives. This perk may be taken a second time, but the second choice must come from a different source.
 Narrative Hook: You have stolen from another fate, another soul, another god.

üëÅÔ∏è Veilpiercer
Effect: You may always perceive the false and hidden.
Illusions, glamers, and spectral veils are revealed to you.
Once per scene, you may declare Veilpierced! to nullify a magical disguise, lie, or illusion within sight.
Gain +2 dice when interacting with prophecy, deceit, or phantoms.
 Narrative Hook: The threads of lies break when you pass.



üåÄ Temporal Residue
Effect: When you take damage from any source, you leave behind a temporal echo in that space. This echo lasts 1 round.
50% of attacks targeting you may hit the echo instead.
The echo may mimic simple actions (move, speak, attack‚Äîbut only visually).
 Only one echo may exist at a time.
 Narrative Hook: Time remembers you‚Äîbadly.


ü¶¥ Flesh of Myth
Effect: Your body has transcended the boundaries of mortality.
+1 maximum HP per level.
Immunity to poison, disease, aging, petrification, and dismemberment.
You may still be slain‚Äîbut not easily, nor cleanly.
 Narrative Hook: You are not legend. You are what legends fear.



üî• Soulfire Conversion
Effect: Once per rest, as a Bonus Action, you may convert your physical vitality into raw power. You may burn HP (in multiples of 3) to gain 1 point of:
Soul Energy


Blood


Glyph Charges
 (Maximum conversion: Your Level in HP / 3).
 Narrative Hook: Pain is just the coin you pay for power.



üïØÔ∏è Cradle of Ruin
Effect: When reduced to 0 HP, unleash a pulse of devastation.
All enemies within 20 ft take 4d6 damage (Soul or Physical; you choose).


Allies in the area gain +2 DR and +1 die on all rolls until the end of their next turn.


At the start of your next turn, rise with 1 HP.
 Narrative Hook: You die like a god‚Äîand rise like a curse.



‚úß Reality Fracture
Effect: Once per session, you may describe an impossible act: walking through unbroken time, halting a death mid-scream, crossing space in a blink. This Reality Fracture must:
Be narratively powerful but not permanently game-breaking.
Not grant permanent resources or negate entire plot arcs.
Be resolved creatively by the GM.
 Narrative Hook: You do not bend rules. You leave them shattered.





üß™ Corrupted Perks (Unlocked via narrative triggers or corruption threshold)
What is a Corruption Threshold?
A corruption threshold is a measure of how far a character has fallen into dark magic, forbidden knowledge, or unnatural transformation. It can be represented by a corruption score, number of corruption dice, or key narrative events. As your corruption increases, more powerful perks become available‚Äîbut so do the risks to your mind, body, and soul. Every game session you must get through a pool of corruption dice = 2x your corruption level. If you wish to push your roll, you will need to roll your corruption lvl /3 rounded up die per push. 
Social Reactions: NPCs, particularly those aligned with order, faith, or purity (like Sarafan or devout humans), might react more negatively to characters with visible signs of corruption or a palpable aura of taint, leading to social penalties or mistrust. Conversely, certain dark entities or factions might show increased interest or offer unique opportunities.
Environmental Interaction: Heavily corrupted characters might find themselves subtly influencing their immediate environment in minor, unsettling ways (e.g., lights dimming, shadows deepening, animals becoming agitated). Conversely, they might find themselves weakened or pained in areas of strong purity or sanctification.

Ways to Purify Corruption

1. Rituals of Purification:
These are demanding, often ancient, and perilous rites that directly confront and attempt to expel corrupting influences from a character's soul or body. Success is not guaranteed and failure can be costly.
Mechanics & Requirements:
Discovery: The knowledge of such rituals would be rare, possibly found in forgotten lore, learned from a unique NPC (like an ancient vampire who regrets their fall, a secluded Oracle-Blooded, or a Warden of Balance with access to old rites), or pieced together from fragmented texts.
Components: Rituals would require specific, often rare and difficult-to-obtain material components. Examples:
Tears of a repentant innocent.
Untainted blood from a creature of pure lineage.
A heartwood branch from an ancient, uncorrupted tree.
Dust from a Pillar of Nosgoth (or a fragment).
Specially inscribed glyphs or consecrated items.
Location: Many rituals might need to be performed at a specific type of location, such as a restored holy site, a natural place of power untouched by corruption, or even a dangerously balanced point between the Material and Spectral Realms.
Casting & Skill Checks: The ritual would likely take significant in-game time to perform (hours or even days). It would involve one or more difficult skill checks, typically using Soul + Rituals, Will + Concentration, or perhaps Will + Forbidden Knowledge if attempting to use a controlled form of counter-corruption. The Difficulty Rating (DR) should be high (e.g., DR 3 or 4, or even involve multiple escalating checks).
Cost & Risk:
The ritual might consume valuable resources or have a direct cost in Soul Energy, Blood Points, or even temporary HP/Attribute reduction for the caster or the subject.
Failure could lead to backlash: increasing Corruption instead, attracting hostile entities (spectral or demonic), inflicting Sanity damage, or causing a temporary physical or magical affliction.
Critical failure might have even more severe narrative consequences.
Narrative Integration:
The quest to find the ritual's components, location, or knowledge can form an entire story arc.
The ritual itself can be a tense, dramatic scene, possibly requiring other party members to defend the caster or participant.
The outcome might not be a complete cleansing but a reduction, or the character might gain a new understanding or a minor boon related to their struggle.
2. Acts of Atonement or Defiance:
This method ties Corruption reduction to significant narrative choices and character development, where a character actively works against the nature of their corruption or the forces that caused it.
Mechanics & Requirements:
Significant Narrative Acts: These are not minor good deeds but substantial, often perilous actions that clearly demonstrate a change of heart or a direct challenge to the source of corruption. Examples:
A vampire who gained Corruption through ruthless feeding might undertake a quest to protect a human settlement from other predators, risking starvation or reprisal from their own kind.
A Hylden Warlock might destroy a powerful Hylden artifact they were meant to use, severing a tie to their corrupting heritage.
A character corrupted by forbidden magic could expose and dismantle a cult that propagates those same dark arts.
GM Adjudication: The GM determines what constitutes a truly significant act worthy of reducing Corruption. It should be genuinely challenging and reflect a core aspect of the character's internal struggle.
No Direct Roll (Usually): The act itself is the "cost." However, the success of the act might involve various skill checks throughout the related quest. The Corruption reduction is a reward for the narrative achievement.
Narrative Integration:
These acts should be deeply personal to the character's story and their specific type of corruption.
They provide powerful roleplaying opportunities and can lead to significant character growth.
The reduction in Corruption might be gradual, tied to completing stages of a larger redemptive arc, or a significant one-time reduction after a climactic act of defiance.
Such acts might also have social consequences ‚Äì former allies might become enemies, or vice versa.
3. Seeking Aid from Unique NPCs or Entities:
Nosgoth is filled with ancient and powerful beings. Some might possess the knowledge or ability to cleanse or mitigate Corruption, though their aid will rarely come without a price.
Mechanics & Requirements:
Identifying Potential Aid: Characters would need to learn of these entities through research (History, Forbidden Knowledge ), rumors, or direct encounters. Examples:
An ancient, reclusive vampire who found a path to resist the worst of the curse.
A powerful Warden of Balance dedicated to cleansing Nosgoth's taints.
A mysterious Oracle-Blooded with unique insight into spiritual afflictions.
Even a powerful, neutral spectral entity or a lesser cosmic being with its own agenda.
The Price of Aid: The entity will likely demand a significant service, a rare artifact, a binding oath, or a sacrifice in return for their help. This forms the basis of a new quest or obligation.
Process of Cleansing: The method of cleansing would depend on the entity. It could involve a unique ritual they perform, a trial the character must undergo, the imbibing of a rare potion, or a direct transference of power/corruption. This might involve skill checks for the character to endure the process or for the NPC to succeed.
Narrative Integration:
Finding and convincing such an entity to help can be a major undertaking.
The service or price demanded can lead to further adventures and moral quandaries.
The cleansing might not be total or might come with unforeseen side effects or new responsibilities. For instance, being cleansed by a Warden might indebt the character to the cause of Balance.
4. Downtime Activities & Focused Contemplation:
This method offers a slower, more introspective path to resisting or slightly reducing Corruption, suitable for periods of relative safety or between major adventures.
Mechanics & Requirements:
Significant Downtime: This requires a substantial period of uninterrupted downtime (e.g., weeks or even months in-game) where the character can dedicate themselves to specific practices.
Activities:
Focused Meditation & Willpower Training: The character engages in intense mental discipline to strengthen their will against corrupting influences. This could involve a series of Will + Concentration checks over the downtime period, with cumulative successes leading to a small reduction in Corruption Score.
Spiritual Cleansing Practices: For characters with a connection to purer spiritual paths (e.g., some Wardens, Oracle-Blooded, or those seeking redemption), this could involve prolonged prayer, fasting, adherence to strict codes of conduct, or seeking solace in untainted natural environments. This might involve Soul + Religion or Will + Nature checks.
Study & Counter-Knowledge: A character might spend downtime researching the nature of their corruption through Forbidden Knowledge or History checks, seeking to understand and thereby gain mastery over its lesser manifestations. This might not reduce the score directly but could grant a temporary bonus to resist specific corruption effects or unlock a minor Corrupted Perk that offers more control.
Limited Effect: This method would generally result in minor reductions to Corruption Score or an increased ability to resist its effects, rather than complete cleansing. It represents a character's personal struggle to maintain their integrity.
Narrative Integration:
This method emphasizes the internal struggle against corruption.
It can be used to reflect a character's ongoing efforts between major story arcs.
The GM can introduce small narrative vignettes during downtime to reflect the character's efforts and the subtle pushback from their inner demons or external corrupting forces.
Success might grant the character new insights or resolve related to their fight against corruption.



ü©∏ Tier 1 Corrupted Perks
Whispers in the Vein ‚Äì You gain +1 to Rituals or Forbidden Knowledge rolls when near cursed objects.

Seeping Hunger ‚Äì Once per scene, absorb 1 HP when near a dying creature.
Flesh-Warp Instinct ‚Äì Gain +1 Evasion when below half HP.

Bonebite Grin ‚Äì You gain a terrifying grin; enemies who see you must succeed a DR 2 Will save or be Shaken.

Whispered Insight
Effect (Passive): You hear faint whispers from the Spectral Realm or Hylden echoes, granting you +1 die on Insight or Forbidden Knowledge checks when discerning hidden motives or arcane secrets.

Drawback: The whispers are distracting; you suffer a -1 die penalty on Concentration checks when in bright light or holy ground, as the voices grow agitated.

Narrative Flavor: Your mind brushes against forbidden truths, as if an unseen entity murmurs secrets just beyond comprehension. Your eyes occasionally flicker with an unnatural glint, unnerving allies. GMs may use this to feed cryptic clues or sow paranoia, hinting at the Elder God‚Äôs influence.


Tainted Vitality
Effect (Reactive): Once per scene, when you take physical damage that would reduce you to 0 HP, you can instead reduce the damage by 2 and remain at 1 HP. This triggers automatically but costs 1 sanity damage.

Drawback: Your body begins to show signs of corruption (e.g., blackened veins or ashen skin), imposing a -1 die penalty on Persuasion checks with uncorrupted NPCs (e.g., Sarafan or Nomads).

Narrative Flavor: The taint within you refuses to let you fall, knitting your flesh with unnatural resilience. Allies may question your humanity, and you feel a growing hunger for blood or souls. This perk ties into the vampire and revenant themes of defying death but at a cost.


Abyssal Reflex
Effect (Active): As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can add +1 success to an Evasion check against a single attack or hazard. This costs 1 Soul Energy (SE).

Drawback: Using this perk leaves you momentarily disoriented by visions of the Abyss; your next attack roll or skill check before the end of your next turn suffers a -1 die penalty.

Narrative Flavor: You tap into the chaotic energies of the Abyss, moving with unnatural speed. Your movements occasionally seem jerky or disjointed, as if pulled by unseen strings. GMs can describe fleeting glimpses of the Hylden‚Äôs banished realm, deepening your character‚Äôs connection to corruption.


Bloodstained Sight
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per scene, you can focus on a bloodsoaked terrain or a bleeding creature within 30 feet (6 squares) to gain +1 die on Observation checks for 1 minute, revealing hidden enemies or spectral traces.

Drawback: After using this ability, you become fixated on blood; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save to avoid attacking or feeding on the nearest bleeding creature (ally or foe) on your next turn. Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for that turn.

Narrative Flavor: Your senses sharpen, drawn to the pulse of life in blood, but it awakens a primal urge. Your pupils dilate unnaturally, and you may lick your lips involuntarily. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, emphasizing their bloodlust while offering utility.


Spectral Whisper
Effect (Passive): You gain +1 die on Stealth checks in the Spectral Realm or areas of obscuring terrain (e.g., mist, darkness). Additionally, you can faintly perceive spectral entities within 15 feet (3 squares) without a skill check, though details require an Observation roll.

Drawback: The Spectral Realm‚Äôs influence frays your sanity; you gain 1 sanity damage whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene.

Narrative Flavor: The veil between realms thins for you, allowing you to move like a ghost but at the cost of your mental stability. You may hear faint, mocking laughter or see shadowy figures in your peripheral vision. This perk aligns with Wraith or Shadowmancer themes, enhancing their stealth while tying to Sanity mechanics.


Corrupted Surge
Effect (Active): Once per short rest, as a Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Corruption Point (if your system tracks them explicitly) or take 1 sanity damage to add +2 damage to your next successful weapon or spell attack this turn.

Drawback: After using this ability, your connection to Nosgoth‚Äôs balance weakens; you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects until you complete a short rest.

Narrative Flavor: You channel the raw, chaotic energy of corruption into a devastating strike, your weapon or spell glowing with an eerie, sickly hue. Your body trembles afterward, and you feel a lingering coldness, as if the Pillars themselves reject you. This perk offers a high-risk, high-reward option for any class, especially those flirting with forbidden power.


üß† Tier 2 Corrupted Perks

Aberrant Surge ‚Äì When you spend Soul Energy, regain 1 HP or remove 1 stress.

Corruption Echo ‚Äì Once per session, repeat the effect of the last spell cast.

Host to the Void ‚Äì Gain immunity to mind control but take 1 corruption per long rest.

Blood Memory ‚Äì Absorb one trait or ability from a corpse you‚Äôve consumed within the last hour.

Veil of the Damned
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per short rest, you summon a 10-foot (2 squares) radius cloud of spectral mist centered on yourself, lasting 1 minute. The area is lightly obscured, granting +1 die to your Stealth checks and imposing a -1 die penalty on enemies‚Äô Observation checks within or targeting the area. You can see normally within the mist. Costs 1 Soul Energy (SE) and 1 sanity damage.
Drawback: The mist clings to you unnaturally; until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects, as the mist marks you as tainted.
Narrative Flavor: You call forth a shroud of souls from the Spectral Realm, their whispers cloaking you in shadow. Your skin takes on a pallid, corpse-like hue, and allies may hear faint cries emanating from you. GMs can use this to hint at the Elder God‚Äôs awareness or attract spectral entities.


Hunger‚Äôs Blade
Effect (Passive): When you deal damage with a melee weapon attack to a living creature with blood, you regain 2 HP, up to once per turn. If the target is bleeding (e.g., from a Sangromancer‚Äôs Hemorrhage), the healing increases to 4 HP.
Drawback: Your hunger intensifies; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save each scene to avoid attacking or feeding on a bleeding ally within 10 feet (2 squares). Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for 1 round.
Narrative Flavor: Your weapon pulses with a sickly red glow, drinking deeply from your foes. Your fangs lengthen, and your eyes glint with predatory need, alarming even your allies. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust while offering sustain.


Hylden‚Äôs Grasp
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per scene, you conjure a glyph of Hylden energy at a point within 30 feet (6 squares). Enemies within a 5-foot (1 square) radius must make a DR 2 Might or Evasion save (their choice). On a failure, they are Rooted for 1 round and take 2 Corruption damage. Costs 2 Soul Energy.
Drawback: Using this ability adds 1 Corruption Point to your total, and you suffer 1 sanity damage as Hylden whispers invade your mind.
Narrative Flavor: You channel the banished Hylden‚Äôs entropy, your hands glowing with sickly green sigils. Your voice occasionally carries an alien timbre, and you dream of a desolate, glyph-scarred wasteland. GMs may use this to foreshadow Hylden incursions or faction suspicion.


Soul Leech
Effect (Active): As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can target a creature within 15 feet (3 squares) that you‚Äôve damaged this turn. They must make a DR 2 Will save or take 3 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you regain 1 Soul Energy (SE).
Drawback: Your soul becomes tainted; until your next long rest, any healing you receive from non-corrupted sources (e.g., holy magic or Balance Wardens) is reduced by 2 HP.
Narrative Flavor: You siphon a fragment of your foe‚Äôs essence, your eyes glowing with stolen light. Your shadow flickers unnaturally, as if alive, and you feel a gnawing emptiness within. This perk aligns with Soul Reavers or Hylden Warlocks, emphasizing soul manipulation.


Abyssal Echo
Effect (Reactive): Once per scene, when you fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can use your Reaction to reroll the save with +1 die. If you succeed, the caster takes 2 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances). Costs 1 sanity damage.
Drawback: The Abyss‚Äôs touch lingers; you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight checks until your next short rest, as reality feels distorted.
Narrative Flavor: You deflect magic with a ripple of void energy, your form briefly glitching like a broken tapestry. Your reflection shows a stranger‚Äôs face, and you hear faint, mocking laughter. This perk suits Unbound or Hylden characters, tying to their resistance to fate.


Corrupted Ferocity
Effect (Active): As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can enter a frenzied state for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +3 damage, but you take 1 physical damage(bypassing Armor) each time you attack. Costs 1 Corruption Point or 2 sanity damage.
Drawback: After the frenzy ends, you‚Äôre exhausted, suffering a -1 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a short rest.
Narrative Flavor: You unleash a torrent of corrupted rage, your body sprouting jagged, bone-like protrusions. Your laughter grows unhinged, and allies may fear you‚Äôre losing control. This perk fits Blood Knights or Turelim, enhancing their combat prowess at a steep cost.



üî• Tier 3 Corrupted Perks
Embodiment of Decay ‚Äì Your presence wilts plants and rusts weapons; enemies in 1-tile radius suffer -1 to all attack rolls.

Eternal Host ‚Äì You cannot be permanently killed while your corruption is 6 or higher; rise again at 1 HP after 1 round.

Eye of the Abyss ‚Äì Once per session, ask a question and receive a disturbing but truthful vision.

The Rot Within ‚Äì When you are critically hit, the attacker takes 2 soul damage.
Soulrend Dominion
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per long rest, you unleash a wave of soul-devouring energy in a 15-foot (3 squares) radius centered on yourself. Enemies in the area must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 6 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and are Frightened for 1 minute (repeat save at end of each turn). On a success, they take 3 Soul damage. You regain 1 Soul Energy (SE) per 
affected enemy. Costs 3 SE and 2 sanity damage.
Drawback: Your soul frays; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and until your next long rest, you suffer a -2 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects. Additionally, spectral entities are drawn to you, increasing the chance of hostile encounters (GM discretion).
Narrative Flavor: You tear at the essence of your foes, your form wreathed in spectral fire. Your eyes burn with an unnatural void, and your voice echoes with a chorus of trapped souls. Allies may fear you‚Äôre becoming a conduit for the Elder God. GMs can use this to introduce spectral pursuers or visions of the Wheel of Fate.


Bloodforged Apotheosis
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per short rest, you transform into a blood-wrought avatar for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +4 damage (Blood damage, bypassing physical Armor), and you gain 5 Temporary HP at the start of each of your turns. Costs 2 Blood Points (BP) and 1 Corruption Point.
Drawback: Your body warps permanently (e.g., crimson veins pulse visibly, or bone spurs protrude); you suffer a -2 die penalty on Persuasion checks with uncorrupted NPCs (e.g., Sarafan, Nomads). After the effect ends, you take 4 physical damage (bypassing Armor) from overexertion.
Narrative Flavor: Your blood boils, reshaping you into a living weapon. Your laughter is guttural, and your presence terrifies mortals. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust but marking them as monstrous. GMs may have factions hunt you as a threat.


Hylden‚Äôs Rift
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per long rest, you tear open a rift to the Hylden‚Äôs banished dimension at a point within 60 feet (12 squares), creating a 10-foot (2 squares) radius zone of chaotic energy for 1 minute. Enemies entering or starting their turn in the zone take 4 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances) and must make a DR 3 Might save or be slowed (half speed) for 1 round. Costs 4 SE and 3 sanity damage.
Drawback: The rift destabilizes you; you gain 2 Corruption Points, and your maximum HP is reduced by 5 until you complete a long rest. The rift may attract Hylden attention, potentially summoning a minor Hylden entity (GM discretion).
Narrative Flavor: You channel the Hylden‚Äôs entropy, your hands glowing with otherworldly sigils. Your dreams are plagued by visions of a shattered realm, and your shadow writhes independently. This perk aligns with Hylden Warlocks, risking cosmic consequences for immense power.


Abyssal Pact
Effect (Active): As a Bonus Action, once per scene, you can sacrifice 5 HP to gain +2 dice on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saves for 1 minute. If you reduce an enemy to 0 HP during this time, you regain 3 HP and 1 SE. 
Drawback: The pact binds you to the Abyss; you gain 1 Corruption Point each time you use this ability, and until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight and Concentration checks as abyssal whispers cloud your mind.
Narrative Flavor: You offer your vitality to an unseen force, your wounds weeping black ichor. Your movements are unnaturally fluid, but your gaze grows distant, as if listening to a voice only you hear. This perk suits Blood Knights or Unbound, offering versatility at a steep cost. GMs can hint at an abyssal entity taking interest.
Wraith‚Äôs Lament
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per short rest, you emit a keening wail that affects all enemies within 30 feet (6 squares). Targets must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 5 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and cannot take Reactions until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take 2 Soul damage. Costs 2 SE and 2 sanity damage.
Drawback: Your connection to the Spectral Realm deepens; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and you suffer 1 sanity damage whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene until your next long rest.
Narrative Flavor: Your wail echoes with the sorrow of lost souls, your form flickering like a dying flame. Your touch grows cold, and mirrors show a gaunt, spectral version of you. This perk fits Wraiths or Shadowmancers, enhancing their spectral prowess but binding them to the Spectral Realm‚Äôs torment.


Corrupted Ascension
Effect (Active): As an Action, once per long rest, you ascend into a corrupted state for 1 minute. You gain a fly speed equal to your movement speed, your attacks deal +3 Corruption damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you ignore difficult terrain. Costs 3 BP or 3 SE and 2 Corruption Points.
Drawback: Your body mutates (e.g., wings of shadow, glowing veins); you suffer a -2 die penalty on all social skill checks with non-corrupted NPCs permanently. After the effect ends, you‚Äôre exhausted, suffering a -2 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a long rest.
Narrative Flavor: You rise on currents of corrupted energy, your form a blasphemy against Nosgoth‚Äôs balance. Your voice carries an otherworldly resonance, and the Pillars seem to shudder in your presence. This perk suits any class, offering mobility and offense but marking you as an outcast. GMs may have the Sarafan or Balance Wardens target you.
