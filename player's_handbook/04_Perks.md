# Chapter 5: Universal Perks System

In the shadowed realms of Nosgoth, power is not merely granted—it is forged through blood, defiance, and the unyielding march toward destiny or ruin. The Universal Perks System allows players to transcend the boundaries of their class and lineage, selecting abilities that weave personal narratives into the fabric of the game. These perks provide mechanical advantages and narrative hooks, reflecting the eternal struggle against corruption, the Spectral Realm, and the Wheel of Fate.

Perks are divided into **Universal Perks** (accessible to all characters) and **Corrupted Perks** (unlocked through narrative triggers or accumulating Corruption). Universal Perks are tiered by level milestones, requiring progression through lower tiers. Corrupted Perks carry inherent risks, embodying the perilous cost of forbidden power.

This chapter outlines perk selection, details each perk in a unified format, and includes summary tables for quick reference. Game Masters (GMs) are encouraged to integrate narrative hooks into campaigns, ensuring perks feel like extensions of Nosgoth's lore.

## Perk Selection and Progression

Players gain access to Universal Perks at the following milestones:
- **Tier 1:** Levels 1–5
- **Tier 2:** Levels 6–10 (Requires at least one Tier 1 perk)
- **Tier 3:** Levels 11–15 (Requires at least one Tier 2 perk)
- **Tier 4:** Levels 16–20 (Requires at least one Tier 3 perk)

At each milestone, players may select one perk from the available tier (subject to GM approval and narrative fit). Perks cannot be changed once selected, emphasizing commitment to a character's path.

Corrupted Perks are unlocked via a **Corruption Threshold** (detailed below) and do not follow the same level-based progression. They offer greater power but at the expense of sanity, social standing, and environmental harmony.

## Universal Perks

### Tier 1 Perks (Levels 1–5)
These foundational perks provide minor but reliable benefits, enhancing survivability, awareness, or tactical edges in Nosgoth's unforgiving world.

#### Detailed Perks
**Blood for Blood**  
*Effect:* Restore 1 HP when you score a critical hit.  
*Narrative Hook:* This perk provides a minor but immediate survivability boost for characters who land powerful blows in combat. In the dangerous world of Nosgoth, any amount of self-healing can be valuable, rewarding offensive success with a bit of resilience, which could be especially useful for frontline combatants.

**Echo Sense**  
*Effect:* Detect hidden or invisible entities within 10 ft.  
*Narrative Hook:* Given Nosgoth's nature, with its Spectral Realm and creatures that might employ stealth (like Shadowmancers or Wraiths), this perk offers a crucial early warning system. It enhances a character's awareness, potentially preventing ambushes or revealing unseen threats common in such a treacherous setting.

**Iron Will**  
*Effect:* Reroll one failed Sanity save per scene.  
*Narrative Hook:* Sanity loss is a significant risk in Nosgoth, especially when dealing with Forbidden Spells, Corruption, or horrific entities like those from the Hylden. This perk provides a crucial lifeline, offering a second chance to resist mental strain and the madness that often accompanies power or terror in this world.

**Glyph Mastery**  
*Effect:* Use glyphs even without class proficiency.  
*Narrative Hook:* Glyphs are a key part of Nosgoth's magic, used for traps and wards. This perk opens up tactical options for characters not inherently skilled in Glyphcasting (a primary skill for Glyph Seekers), allowing them to interact with or perhaps even utilize simpler environmental glyphs they might encounter.

**Shadow’s Edge**  
*Effect:* +1 to rolls made while in dim light or darkness.  
*Narrative Hook:* Nosgoth is a dark, gothic realm, meaning dim light and darkness are common conditions. This perk gives a tangible advantage to characters operating in these shadowed environments, benefiting stealthy approaches, ambushes, or any action taken where light is scarce.

**Spirit Bond**  
*Effect:* Once per long rest, commune with a ghost for insight.  
*Narrative Hook:* The Spectral Realm and its inhabitants (spirits, wraiths) play a significant role in Nosgoth. This perk allows a character to directly seek information from these entities, potentially uncovering secrets, gaining warnings, or understanding past events in a world haunted by echoes.

**Battle Meditation**  
*Effect:* Regain 1 HP after combat if no Sanity was lost.  
*Narrative Hook:* This perk rewards characters who can maintain their composure and avoid mental trauma during stressful combat encounters. It provides a small measure of recovery, encouraging tactical play that minimizes exposure to horrifying or corrupting elements, which are prevalent threats.

**Tombborn**  
*Effect:* You may sense undead or cursed ground.  
*Narrative Hook:* Undead creatures and cursed locations are common dangers in a world like Nosgoth, heavily influenced by vampirism and cyclical destruction. This perk acts as an early warning system, allowing characters to better prepare for or avoid such blighted areas and their inhabitants.

**Focused Ritualist**  
*Effect:* Gain +1 to glyphcasting if uninjured.  
*Narrative Hook:* For characters who dabble in or specialize in glyphs, this perk rewards careful positioning and avoiding damage. It enhances the effectiveness of their glyph-related actions when they can maintain a state of readiness, crucial for a magic system that involves precise inscription.

**Death Watcher**  
*Effect:* Detect when an enemy drops below 25% HP.  
*Narrative Hook:* Knowing when a foe is critically wounded can be a significant tactical advantage, allowing a character or party to focus fire, attempt a finishing blow (like the Dreadblade's Death's Whisper perk), or assess threats more accurately in the brutal combat scenarios of Nosgoth.

### Tier 2 Perks (Levels 6–10)
Requires one Tier 1 Universal Perk. These perks build on foundations, offering greater mobility, versatility, and risk-reward mechanics.

#### Summary Table: Tier 2 Universal Perks
| Perk Name       | Effect Summary                          | Key Benefit Type | Frequency/Trigger |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Momentum Kill  | Gain bonus movement after a kill.      | Mobility        | On kill          |
| Phase Slip     | Ignore difficult terrain in Spectral Realm. | Mobility     | Passive          |
| Sanity Tap     | Spend 1 Sanity to add +2 to a roll.    | Versatile Boost | As needed        |
| Void Walker    | Immune to corrupted terrain hazards.   | Environmental   | Passive          |
| Time Echo      | Re-roll one Initiative roll per scene. | Combat Initiative | Per scene       |
| Soul Ward      | Absorb one source of damage.           | Defense         | Once per long rest |
| Spell Siphon   | Steal 1 spell or ability from a foe.   | Versatility     | Once per long rest |
| Spectral Fortitude | +2 Defense in Spectral Realm.       | Survivability   | Passive          |

| Shadow Link    | Teleport to a shadow within 10 ft as a bonus action. | Mobility | Bonus action    |

#### Detailed Perks
**Momentum Kill**  
*Effect:* Gain bonus movement after a kill.  
*Narrative Hook:* This perk rewards characters who can decisively eliminate foes, granting them tactical repositioning to either press the attack against remaining enemies or secure a more advantageous position. In a world where combat can be frequent and deadly, maintaining the initiative through such momentum can be crucial.

**Phase Slip**  
*Effect:* Ignore difficult terrain in Spectral Realm.  
*Narrative Hook:* For characters who can access or are forced into the Spectral Realm (like Wraiths or Soul Reavers), this perk significantly enhances their mobility. The Spectral Realm is described as having distorted physics and warped time, so navigating it efficiently is a key advantage.

**Sanity Tap**  
*Effect:* Spend 1 Sanity to add +2 to a roll.  
*Narrative Hook:* This perk offers a high-risk, high-reward option, embodying the theme of power having a price. In critical moments, a character can channel their mental fortitude or perhaps touch upon dangerous insights to significantly boost their chance of success on any given roll, at the cost of their mental well-being – a common peril in Nosgoth.

**Void Walker**  
*Effect:* Immune to corrupted terrain hazards.  
*Narrative Hook:* Nosgoth is a fractured world rife with corruption, which can manifest as hazardous terrain. This perk allows characters to traverse such blighted areas unscathed, invaluable for exploring ancient ruins or confronting sources of decay without succumbing to their environmental toll.

**Time Echo**  
*Effect:* Re-roll one Initiative roll per scene.  
*Narrative Hook:* Initiative determines the order of action in combat, which can be critical. This perk allows a character to manipulate this crucial aspect once per scene, potentially turning a poor initiative roll into a much better one, reflecting the themes of time manipulation and defying predetermined outcomes present in Nosgoth.

**Soul Ward**  
*Effect:* Once per long rest, absorb one source of damage.  
*Narrative Hook:* This provides a potent defensive measure, allowing a character to completely negate a single damaging attack or effect once per long rest. In a world with powerful foes and devastating abilities, this can be a life-saving tool, representing a powerful personal ward against harm.

**Spell Siphon**  
*Effect:* Steal 1 spell or ability from a foe once per long rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* This remarkable perk allows a character to temporarily acquire an enemy's magical capability, offering incredible versatility and a way to turn an opponent's strength against them. It speaks to the volatile and often stolen nature of power in Nosgoth.

**Spectral Fortitude**  
*Effect:* Gain +2 Defense in Spectral Realm.  
*Narrative Hook:* For characters who frequently operate or fight within the Spectral Realm, this perk significantly boosts their survivability by making them harder to hit in that specific plane of existence, where different rules and dangers apply.

**Blood Alchemy**  
*Effect:* Convert HP into temporary Soul Energy.  
*Narrative Hook:* This perk allows characters to sacrifice their physical vitality (HP) for magical power (Soul Energy), reflecting the often costly nature of magic and the interconnectedness of life force and spiritual essence. It's particularly useful for casters needing a quick SE boost in a pinch.

**Shadow Link**  
*Effect:* Teleport to a shadow within 10 ft as a bonus action.  
*Narrative Hook:* Granting short-range teleportation via shadows as a quick action provides significant tactical mobility. This is invaluable for stealthy characters like Shadowmancers or any character wishing to quickly reposition, engage, or disengage in Nosgoth's often dimly lit environments.

### Tier 3 Perks (Levels 11–15)
Requires one Tier 2 Universal Perk. These perks represent ascension, offering transformative abilities that alter combat, exploration, or narrative dynamics.

#### Summary Table: Tier 3 Universal Perks
| Perk Name        | Effect Summary                          | Key Benefit Type | Frequency/Trigger |

#### Detailed Perks
**Cyclebreaker’s Defiance**  
*Prerequisite:* None  
*Effect:* Once per long rest, when you would be reduced to 0 HP, irreversibly corrupted, banished, or erased from existence, you may instead declare defiance. You are restored to 1 HP, all Corruption is cleansed, and you may immediately take a full turn (outside the normal initiative order). This breaks natural laws; you gain 1 permanent Corruption afterward.  
*Narrative Hook:* You have slipped the Wheel’s noose—again. Something noticed.

**Paradox Strike**  
*Prerequisite:* Must possess a time-, soul-, or phase-based ability  
*Effect:* Once per scene, when you hit with a melee or ranged attack, the wound echoes through time. At the start of the target’s next turn, they suffer the same damage again. This repeated damage bypasses resistances but not immunities.

**Spectral Anchor**

**Legacy Transfusion**  
*Prerequisite:* None

*Narrative Hook:* You have stolen from another fate, another soul, another god.

**Veilpiercer**  
*Prerequisite:* None  
*Effect:* You may always perceive the false and hidden. Illusions, glamers, and spectral veils are revealed to you. Once per scene, you may declare Veilpierced! to nullify a magical disguise, lie, or illusion within sight. Gain +2 dice when interacting with prophecy, deceit, or phantoms.  
*Narrative Hook:* The threads of lies break when you pass.

**Temporal Residue**  
*Prerequisite:* None  
*Effect:* When you take damage from any source, you leave behind a temporal echo in that space. This echo lasts 1 round. 50% of attacks targeting you may hit the echo instead. The echo may mimic simple actions (move, speak, attack—but only visually). Only one echo may exist at a time.  
*Narrative Hook:* Time remembers you—badly.

**Flesh of Myth**  
*Prerequisite:* None  
*Effect:* Your body has transcended the boundaries of mortality. +1 maximum HP per level. Immunity to poison, disease, aging, petrification, and dismemberment. You may still be slain—but not easily, nor cleanly.

**Soulfire Conversion**  
*Prerequisite:* None

*Prerequisite:* None  
*Effect:* Once per session, you may describe an impossible act: walking through unbroken time, halting a death mid-scream, crossing space in a blink. This Reality Fracture must: Be narratively powerful but not permanently game-breaking. Not grant permanent resources or negate entire plot arcs. Be resolved creatively by the GM.  
*Narrative Hook:* You do not bend rules. You leave them shattered.

## Corrupted Perks

Corrupted Perks represent a fall into dark magic, forbidden knowledge, or unnatural transformation. They are unlocked via narrative triggers or reaching Corruption Thresholds, measured by a Corruption Score (or equivalent narrative events). As Corruption increases, perks become available—but so do risks to mind, body, and soul.

### The Corruption Threshold
A character's Corruption Threshold tracks their descent. Every session, roll a pool of Corruption Dice = 2 × Corruption Level. Pushing rolls requires rolling (Corruption Level / 3, rounded up) additional dice per push.

#### Summary Table: Corruption Levels
| Corruption Level | State                | Effects and Unlocks                          | Social/Environmental Impact |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1–3             | Touched by corruption | Roleplay cues; no perks yet.                | Minor unsettling aura.     |
| 3–6             | Marked by corruption | Tier 1 Corrupted Perks; roll 2× Level dice per session. | Negative reactions from pure NPCs; subtle environmental influence (e.g., dimming lights). |
| 7–10            | Deeply corrupted     | Tier 2 Corrupted Perks; roll 2× Level dice per session. | Increased mistrust; weakened in pure areas. |
| 11–15           | Abyss-bound          | Tier 3 Corrupted Perks; roll 2× Level dice per session. | Hostile reactions; attract dark entities; painful in sanctified zones. |

**Social Reactions:** NPCs aligned with order or purity (e.g., Sarafan) react negatively, imposing social penalties. Dark factions may offer opportunities.

**Environmental Interaction:** High Corruption subtly warps surroundings (e.g., agitated animals) or weakens the character in pure areas.

### Tier 1 Corrupted Perks
Unlocked at Corruption 3–6. These introduce minor tainted benefits with drawbacks.

#### Summary Table: Tier 1 Corrupted Perks
| Perk Name          | Effect Summary                          | Drawback Summary                        | Frequency/Trigger |

#### Detailed Perks
**Whispers in the Vein**  
*Effect:* You gain +1 to Rituals or Forbidden Knowledge rolls when near cursed objects.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* The taint calls to you, unlocking secrets from accursed artifacts.

**Seeping Hunger**  
*Effect:* Once per scene, absorb 1 HP when near a dying creature.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your essence draws life from the dying, sustaining you in moments of peril.

**Flesh-Warp Instinct**  
*Effect:* Gain +1 Evasion when below half HP.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Corruption twists your form, granting unnatural agility when wounded.

**Bonebite Grin**  
*Effect:* You gain a terrifying grin; enemies who see you must succeed a DR 2 Will save or be Shaken.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* A grotesque smile unnerves foes, sowing fear in battle.

**Whispered Insight**  
*Effect:* You hear faint whispers from the Spectral Realm or Hylden echoes, granting you +1 die on Insight or Forbidden Knowledge checks when discerning hidden motives or arcane secrets.  
*Drawback:* The whispers are distracting; you suffer a -1 die penalty on Concentration checks when in bright light or holy ground, as the voices grow agitated.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your mind brushes against forbidden truths, as if an unseen entity murmurs secrets just beyond comprehension. Your eyes occasionally flicker with an unnatural glint, unnerving allies. GMs may use this to feed cryptic clues or sow paranoia, hinting at the Elder God’s influence.

**Tainted Vitality**  
*Effect:* Once per scene, when you take physical damage that would reduce you to 0 HP, you can instead reduce the damage by 2 and remain at 1 HP. This triggers automatically but costs 1 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* Your body begins to show signs of corruption (e.g., blackened veins or ashen skin), imposing a -1 die penalty on Persuasion checks with uncorrupted NPCs (e.g., Sarafan or Nomads).  
*Narrative Hook:* The taint within you refuses to let you fall, knitting your flesh with unnatural resilience. Allies may question your humanity, and you feel a growing hunger for blood or souls. This perk ties into the vampire and revenant themes of defying death but at a cost.

**Abyssal Reflex**  
*Effect:* As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can add +1 success to an Evasion check against a single attack or hazard. This costs 1 Soul Energy (SE).  
*Drawback:* Using this perk leaves you momentarily disoriented by visions of the Abyss; your next attack roll or skill check before the end of your next turn suffers a -1 die penalty.  
*Narrative Hook:* You tap into the chaotic energies of the Abyss, moving with unnatural speed. Your movements occasionally seem jerky or disjointed, as if pulled by unseen strings. GMs can describe fleeting glimpses of the Hylden’s banished realm, deepening your character’s connection to corruption.

**Bloodstained Sight**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per scene, you can focus on a bloodsoaked terrain or a bleeding creature within 30 feet (6 squares) to gain +1 die on Observation checks for 1 minute, revealing hidden enemies or spectral traces.  
*Drawback:* After using this ability, you become fixated on blood; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save to avoid attacking or feeding on the nearest bleeding creature (ally or foe) on your next turn. Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for that turn.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your senses sharpen, drawn to the pulse of life in blood, but it awakens a primal urge. Your pupils dilate unnaturally, and you may lick your lips involuntarily. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, emphasizing their bloodlust while offering utility.

**Spectral Whisper**  
*Effect:* You gain +1 die on Stealth checks in the Spectral Realm or areas of obscuring terrain (e.g., mist, darkness). Additionally, you can faintly perceive spectral entities within 15 feet (3 squares) without a skill check, though details require an Observation roll.  
*Drawback:* The Spectral Realm’s influence frays your sanity; you gain 1 sanity damage whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene.  
*Narrative Hook:* The veil between realms thins for you, allowing you to move like a ghost but at the cost of your mental stability. You may hear faint, mocking laughter or see shadowy figures in your peripheral vision. This perk aligns with Wraith or Shadowmancer themes, enhancing their stealth while tying to Sanity mechanics.

**Corrupted Surge**  
*Effect:* Once per short rest, as a Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Corruption Point (if your system tracks them explicitly) or take 1 sanity damage to add +2 damage to your next successful weapon or spell attack this turn.  
*Drawback:* After using this ability, your connection to Nosgoth’s balance weakens; you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects until you complete a short rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* You channel the raw, chaotic energy of corruption into a devastating strike, your weapon or spell glowing with an eerie, sickly hue. Your body trembles afterward, and you feel a lingering coldness, as if the Pillars themselves reject you.

#### Detailed Perks
**Aberrant Surge**  
*Effect:* When you spend Soul Energy, regain 1 HP or remove 1 stress.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Corruption surges through you, mending wounds as you wield forbidden energies.

**Corruption Echo**  
*Effect:* Once per session, repeat the effect of the last spell cast.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Echoes of taint allow you to relive moments of power, bending reality's remnants.

**Host to the Void**  
*Effect:* Gain immunity to mind control but take 1 corruption per long rest.  
*Drawback:* +1 Corruption per long rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* The void resides within, shielding your will but eroding your essence.

**Blood Memory**  
*Effect:* Absorb one trait or ability from a corpse you’ve consumed within the last hour.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Devouring the fallen grants fleeting echoes of their strength, a vampiric legacy.

**Veil of the Damned**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per short rest, you summon a 10-foot (2 squares) radius cloud of spectral mist centered on yourself, lasting 1 minute. The area is lightly obscured, granting +1 die to your Stealth checks and imposing a -1 die penalty on enemies’ Observation checks within or targeting the area. You can see normally within the mist. Costs 1 Soul Energy (SE) and 1 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* The mist clings to you unnaturally; until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects, as the mist marks you as tainted.  
*Narrative Hook:* You call forth a shroud of souls from the Spectral Realm, their whispers cloaking you in shadow. Your skin takes on a pallid, corpse-like hue, and allies may hear faint cries emanating from you. GMs can use this to hint at the Elder God’s awareness or attract spectral entities.

**Hunger’s Blade**  
*Effect:* When you deal damage with a melee weapon attack to a living creature with blood, you regain 2 HP, up to once per turn. If the target is bleeding (e.g., from a Sangromancer’s Hemorrhage), the healing increases to 4 HP.  
*Drawback:* Your hunger intensifies; you must succeed on a DR 2 Will save each scene to avoid attacking or feeding on a bleeding ally within 10 feet (2 squares). Failure imposes a -1 die penalty on non-attack actions for 1 round.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your weapon pulses with a sickly red glow, drinking deeply from your foes. Your fangs lengthen, and your eyes glint with predatory need, alarming even your allies. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust while offering sustain.

**Hylden’s Grasp**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per scene, you conjure a glyph of Hylden energy at a point within 30 feet (6 squares). Enemies within a 5-foot (1 square) radius must make a DR 2 Might or Evasion save (their choice). On a failure, they are Rooted for 1 round and take 2 Corruption damage. Costs 2 Soul Energy.  
*Drawback:* Using this ability adds 1 Corruption Point to your total, and you suffer 1 sanity damage as Hylden whispers invade your mind.  
*Narrative Hook:* You channel the banished Hylden’s entropy, your hands glowing with sickly green sigils. Your voice occasionally carries an alien timbre, and you dream of a desolate, glyph-scarred wasteland. GMs may use this to foreshadow Hylden incursions or faction suspicion.

**Soul Leech**  
*Effect:* As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can target a creature within 15 feet (3 squares) that you’ve damaged this turn. They must make a DR 2 Will save or take 3 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you regain 1 Soul Energy (SE).  
*Drawback:* Your soul becomes tainted; until your next long rest, any healing you receive from non-corrupted sources (e.g., holy magic or Balance Wardens) is reduced by 2 HP.  
*Narrative Hook:* You siphon a fragment of your foe’s essence, your eyes glowing with stolen light. Your shadow flickers unnaturally, as if alive, and you feel a gnawing emptiness within. This perk aligns with Soul Reavers or Hylden Warlocks, emphasizing soul manipulation.

**Abyssal Echo**  
*Effect:* Once per scene, when you fail a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can use your Reaction to reroll the save with +1 die. If you succeed, the caster takes 2 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances). Costs 1 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* The Abyss’s touch lingers; you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight checks until your next short rest, as reality feels distorted.  
*Narrative Hook:* You deflect magic with a ripple of void energy, your form briefly glitching like a broken tapestry. Your reflection shows a stranger’s face, and you hear faint, mocking laughter. This perk suits Unbound or Hylden characters, tying to their resistance to fate.

**Corrupted Ferocity**  
*Effect:* As a Bonus Action, once per short rest, you can enter a frenzied state for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +3 damage, but you take 1 physical damage (bypassing Armor) each time you attack. Costs 1 Corruption Point or 2 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* After the frenzy ends, you’re exhausted, suffering a -1 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a short rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* You unleash a torrent of corrupted rage, your body sprouting jagged, bone-like protrusions. Your laughter grows unhinged, and allies may fear you’re losing control. This perk fits Blood Knights or Turelim, enhancing their combat prowess at a steep cost.

*Drawback:* None specified.

*Narrative Hook:* Corruption anchors your soul, defying death's finality.

**Eye of the Abyss**

*Effect:* When you are critically hit, the attacker takes 2 soul damage.  
*Drawback:* None specified.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your corrupted essence retaliates, turning wounds into weapons.

**Soulrend Dominion**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per long rest, you unleash a wave of soul-devouring energy in a 15-foot (3 squares) radius centered on yourself. Enemies in the area must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 6 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and are Frightened for 1 minute (repeat save at end of each turn). On a success, they take 3 Soul damage. You regain 1 Soul Energy (SE) per affected enemy. Costs 3 SE and 2 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* Your soul frays; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and until your next long rest, you suffer a -2 die penalty on saves against Radiant or holy effects. Additionally, spectral entities are drawn to you, increasing the chance of hostile encounters (GM discretion).  
*Narrative Hook:* You tear at the essence of your foes, your form wreathed in spectral fire. Your eyes burn with an unnatural void, and your voice echoes with a chorus of trapped souls. Allies may fear you’re becoming a conduit for the Elder God. GMs can use this to introduce spectral pursuers or visions of the Wheel of Fate.

**Bloodforged Apotheosis**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per short rest, you transform into a blood-wrought avatar for 1 minute. Your melee attacks deal +4 damage (Blood damage, bypassing physical Armor), and you gain 5 Temporary HP at the start of each of your turns. Costs 2 Blood Points (BP) and 1 Corruption Point.  
*Drawback:* Your body warps permanently (e.g., crimson veins pulse visibly, or bone spurs protrude); you suffer a -2 die penalty on Persuasion checks with uncorrupted NPCs (e.g., Sarafan, Nomads). After the effect ends, you take 4 physical damage (bypassing Armor) from overexertion.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your blood boils, reshaping you into a living weapon. Your laughter is guttural, and your presence terrifies mortals. This perk suits vampires or Sangromancers, amplifying their bloodlust but marking them as monstrous. GMs may have factions hunt you as a threat.

**Hylden’s Rift**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per long rest, you tear open a rift to the Hylden’s banished dimension at a point within 60 feet (12 squares), creating a 10-foot (2 squares) radius zone of chaotic energy for 1 minute. Enemies entering or starting their turn in the zone take 4 Void damage (bypassing all Armor and resistances) and must make a DR 3 Might save or be slowed (half speed) for 1 round. Costs 4 SE and 3 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* The rift destabilizes you; you gain 2 Corruption Points, and your maximum HP is reduced by 5 until you complete a long rest. The rift may attract Hylden attention, potentially summoning a minor Hylden entity (GM discretion).  
*Narrative Hook:* You channel the Hylden’s entropy, your hands glowing with otherworldly sigils. Your dreams are plagued by visions of a shattered realm, and your shadow writhes independently. This perk aligns with Hylden Warlocks, risking cosmic consequences for immense power.

**Abyssal Pact**  
*Effect:* As a Bonus Action, once per scene, you can sacrifice 5 HP to gain +2 dice on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saves for 1 minute. If you reduce an enemy to 0 HP during this time, you regain 3 HP and 1 SE.  
*Drawback:* The pact binds you to the Abyss; you gain 1 Corruption Point each time you use this ability, and until your next short rest, you suffer a -1 die penalty on Insight and Concentration checks as abyssal whispers cloud your mind.  
*Narrative Hook:* You offer your vitality to an unseen force, your wounds weeping black ichor. Your movements are unnaturally fluid, but your gaze grows distant, as if listening to a voice only you hear. This perk suits Blood Knights or Unbound, offering versatility at a steep cost. GMs can hint at an abyssal entity taking interest.

**Wraith’s Lament**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per short rest, you emit a keening wail that affects all enemies within 30 feet (6 squares). Targets must make a DR 3 Will save. On a failure, they take 5 Soul damage (bypassing physical Armor) and cannot take Reactions until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take 2 Soul damage. Costs 2 SE and 2 sanity damage.  
*Drawback:* Your connection to the Spectral Realm deepens; you gain 1 Corruption Point, and you suffer 1 sanity damage whenever you enter or remain in the Spectral Realm for more than 1 minute per scene until your next long rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* Your wail echoes with the sorrow of lost souls, your form flickering like a dying flame. Your touch grows cold, and mirrors show a gaunt, spectral version of you. This perk fits Wraiths or Shadowmancers, enhancing their spectral prowess but binding them to the Spectral Realm’s torment.

**Corrupted Ascension**  
*Effect:* As an Action, once per long rest, you ascend into a corrupted state for 1 minute. You gain a fly speed equal to your movement speed, your attacks deal +3 Corruption damage (bypassing physical Armor), and you ignore difficult terrain. Costs 3 BP or 3 SE and 2 Corruption Points.  
*Drawback:* Your body mutates (e.g., wings of shadow, glowing veins); you suffer a -2 die penalty on all social skill checks with non-corrupted NPCs permanently. After the effect ends, you’re exhausted, suffering a -2 die penalty on all Might and Evasion checks until you complete a long rest.  
*Narrative Hook:* You rise on currents of corrupted energy, your form a blasphemy against Nosgoth’s balance. Your voice carries an otherworldly resonance, and the Pillars seem to shudder in your presence. This perk suits any class, offering mobility and offense but marking you as an outcast. GMs may have the Sarafan or Balance Wardens target you.

## Ways to Purify Corruption

Corruption is not irreversible. Characters may seek purification through demanding paths, each tying into Nosgoth's lore and requiring narrative investment. Success reduces Corruption Score but often at great cost.

1. **Rituals of Purification**  
   These ancient rites expel taint but demand rare components (e.g., tears of a repentant innocent, Pillar dust) and specific locations (e.g., holy sites). Involve high DR skill checks (Soul + Rituals, DR 3–4). Failure risks backlash (increased Corruption, Sanity damage). Narrative: Forms a story arc with party involvement.

2. **Acts of Atonement or Defiance**  
   Significant actions against corruption's source (e.g., protecting a settlement from predators, destroying a Hylden artifact). GM-adjudicated; no direct roll, but quests involve checks. Narrative: Personal growth, with social consequences (e.g., turning allies to enemies).

3. **Seeking Aid from Unique NPCs or Entities**  
   Approach reclusive figures (e.g., ancient vampires, Wardens of Balance) for aid, in exchange for quests or oaths. Involves endurance checks or unique rituals. Narrative: Leads to moral quandaries and new obligations; partial cleansing possible with side effects.

4. **Downtime Activities & Focused Contemplation**  
   During weeks/months of downtime, engage in meditation (Will + Concentration checks), spiritual practices (Soul + Religion), or research (Forbidden Knowledge). Yields minor reductions or resistances. Narrative: Reflects internal struggle; GM adds vignettes of inner demons.

Purification emphasizes roleplay and balance, preventing Corruption from becoming a permanent trap while rewarding redemptive arcs.
