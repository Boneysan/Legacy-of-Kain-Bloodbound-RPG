## 10.1 Dice Success System

The Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG uses a **D6-based success system**. This mechanic drives all core actions, from combat to exploration, and is designed to emphasize risk, tension, and the dramatic weight of every roll.

### 10.1.1 Rolling Dice

* Players roll a **pool of D6s** equal to **Attribute + Skill**.
* **Attack rolls** also add a **Combat Bonus**: +1 die at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20 (cumulative, max +4). This does not apply to skill checks.
* **5 or 6 = 1 Success.**
* The number of successes required for any **non-combat task** is determined by its **Difficulty Rating (DR)**. This is a number set by the Game Master, typically from 1 to 4, based on the challenge's complexity.

| DR | Challenge Level | Required Successes |
| -- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 0  | Trivial         | 0 (auto-success)   |
| 1  | Simple          | 1 success          |
| 2  | Standard        | 2 successes        |
| 3  | Challenging     | 3 successes        |
| 4  | Difficult       | 4 successes        |
| 5+ | Extreme/Legendary | 5+ successes     |

**Resolution:**

| Successes | Outcome | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | **Failure** | The action fails; the GM may introduce a complication or consequence. |
| 1 | **Marginal** | The action barely succeeds, often with a cost, caveat, or unforeseen complication. |
| 2 | **Standard** | The action succeeds cleanly as intended. |
| 3+ | **Exceptional** | An outstanding result. If this exceeds the DR/DV by 2+, it is a Critical Success or Critical Hit — see section 10.4.6. |

---

## 10.2 Extra Successes: Enhancing Actions

If a player rolls more successes than required, they may choose to **enhance their outcome**:

**In Combat:**

* +1 damage per extra success (maximum +3, or up to the weapon's listed cap; whichever is lower).
* Inflict a status effect based on the attack's damage type (see below).
* Strike multiple targets (GM discretion).
* Ignore 1 point of armor per extra success (maximum equal to the weapon's base damage).

**Status Effects by Damage Type:**

Spending extra successes allows you to apply a status effect. Available effects depend on damage type. Armor interactions are noted below — these apply to all attacks of that type, not only when spending extra successes.

| Damage Type | Armor Interaction | Available Status Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical** (Bludgeon/Pierce/Slash) | Reduced by Armor normally | *Staggered* (no Reactions), *Bleeding* (damage over time), *Prone* |
| **Elemental** (Fire/Cold/Lightning) | Armor value halved | *Burning* (fire damage over time), *Slowed* (half speed), *Shocked* (Disadvantage) |
| **Force** (Telekinetic/Explosive) | Bypasses Armor entirely | *Pushed* (5–10 ft), *Prone* |
| **Spectral** (Soul/Spiritual) | Ignores Armor; affects spirits | *Soul Drain* (transfer SE from target to attacker), *Bypasses Armor* |
| **Radiant** (Holy/Soulfire) | Normal; ×2 damage vs. Undead/Spectral | *Blinded* (Disadvantage), *Purged* (removes shadow/corruption effects) |
| **Entropic** (Necrotic/Void/Corruption) | Normal; damage cannot be healed | *Decay* (prevents healing), *Corrupted* (+1 Corruption), *Weakened* (−1 die on saves) |

**Outside Combat:**

* Perform faster, quieter, or with added flair.
* Gain a narrative advantage (e.g., spotting details, creating openings).
* Create a stunt (leap to higher ground, grab an item mid-battle, etc.).

## 10.3 Advantage and Disadvantage

Situational factors can grant you **Advantage** or impose **Disadvantage** on a roll. This system gives you a second chance—either to turn failure into success, or to have your success snatched away by fate.

**Advantage (Re-roll Failures)**

When you have Advantage, roll your dice pool once. After the roll, you may **pick up any dice that failed (showing 4 or less) and re-roll them**. Add any new successes to your initial total. This gives you a chance to improve a mediocre outcome.

**Disadvantage (Re-roll Half Successes)**

When you have Disadvantage, roll your dice pool once. After the roll, you must **pick up half of your successes (round up) and re-roll them**. Only those re-rolled dice that still show 5 or 6 count as successes; the rest become failures. Successes not selected for re-rolling are kept. This makes Disadvantage punishing without making success nearly impossible.

**Canceling**

If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage from different sources, they cancel each other out, and you simply roll your dice pool once as normal.

**Narrative Adjudication:**
The GM decides how extra successes manifest, but players are encouraged to propose creative outcomes.

*Examples:*

* 4 successes on a DR 2 Stealth check: not only succeed, but also disable a trap silently.
* 3 successes on a DR 1 attack: cleave through a shield or decapitate the target.

## 10.4 Combat System

Combat in Nosgoth reflects the brutal, tactical, and often supernatural struggle of its denizens. Every exchange carries weight—each strike a test of willpower, blood, and fate.

### 10.4.1 Initiative

* Roll D6s equal to **Shadow + Tactics**.
* Highest number of successes acts first.
* Ties broken by Shadow stat, then GM discretion.

---

### 10.4.2 Attacks

1. Roll a pool equal to **Attribute + Weapon Mastery**.
2. Each 5–6 = 1 success.
3. Compare successes to target’s **Defense Value (DV)**.

   * DV = number of successes needed to hit.
4. Excess successes = bonus damage or special effects.

*Example:* Roll = 6, 5, 3, 2 → 2 successes.
Target DV = 1 → hit. One excess success remains (usable for bonus damage or an effect).

---

### 10.4.3 Defense and Armor

* **DV:** Base = 1 + higher of (Shadow or Will) + modifiers (worn armor, perks, active defense).
* **Armor:** Flat reduction of damage (e.g., -2 damage).
* **Active Defense:** Characters may roll reactions such as Dodge or Parry.

---

### 10.4.4 Damage and Health

* **Weapons/abilities** define base damage.
* **Health Points (HP):** Track physical harm.
* 0 HP → unconscious or dying.
* Certain attacks may cause **Wounds or Corruption**.

---

### 10.4.5 Special Actions

* **Spellcasting:** Roll **Soul + Glyphcasting**.
* **Grappling:** Use Unarmed Combat to restrain/disarm.
* **Shifting Realms:** Abilities may allow shifting between Spectral/Material realms mid-combat.
* **Pushes:** After failing a roll, a player may add 1–3 **Corruption Dice** (d6). Each **5–6** adds a success; each **1** increases the character's Corruption Score by 1. See Chapter 8: Corruption for full mechanics.

---

### 10.4.6 Critical Success and Failure

Exceptional outcomes, for better or worse, can dramatically alter a situation.

**Critical Success (Skill Checks)**

When making a non-combat skill check against a DR, **exceeding the DR by 2 or more successes** results in a Critical Success. This doesn't just mean you succeed, but that you do so with extraordinary results, granting a significant narrative benefit.

*   *Examples:* A successful *History* roll might also reveal a hidden secret. A *Persuasion* check might turn a hostile guard into a long-term ally. A *Stealth* check might allow you to map out the entire area.

**Critical Hit (Combat)**

In combat, a Critical Hit is triggered when you **exceed the target's DV by 2 or more successes**. This reflects dominating advantage over a foe — the wider the margin of success, the more devastating the strike.

A Critical Hit allows: bonus damage (+1 per extra success, up to the +3 cap), ignoring Armor, or applying a potent status effect from the damage type table above. See Chapter 9: Combat for the full list of Critical Hit options.

**Pushing a Roll**

When you fail a roll, you may be able to push it by drawing on your inner Corruption. See Chapter 8: Corruption for the full mechanics.

---

### 10.4.7 Environmental Combat

* The battlefield may feature **Spectral/Material terrain, glyph traps, cursed objects**.
* Players can **interact with or destroy terrain** using Strength or Craft.

---

### 10.4.8 Reactions

Each character gets **1 Reaction per round**.

**Trigger Examples:**

* Being targeted by an attack.
* An enemy moving within reach.
* A spell being cast at the character.

**Common Reactions:**

* *Dodge:* Shadow + Evasion → avoid an attack.
* *Parry:* Fury + Weapon Mastery → reduce melee damage.
* *Counterspell:* Soul + Glyphcasting → negate magic.
* *Opportunity Attack:* Strike fleeing/approaching foes.
* *Spectral Shift:* Instantly phase (if trait/spell allows).

**Reaction Roll Outcomes:**

| Successes | Effect                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Reduce damage by 1                          |
| 2         | Reduce damage by 2 OR negate status         |
| 3+        | Halve damage or fully evade (GM discretion) |

---

## 10.5 Closing Note

Combat in Nosgoth is **visceral and cinematic**, blending the brutality of battle with the mysticism of the realms. Success is never binary—extra successes create opportunities for stunts, narrative flourishes, and dramatic escalation. Power always comes with a price, and the dice ensure that every moment hangs in the balance.
