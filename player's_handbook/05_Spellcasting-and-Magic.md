# Chapter 5: Spellcasting in Nosgoth

Magic in Nosgoth is a volatile fusion of soul force, elemental essence, and corrupted power. It serves as both a tool and a curse, capable of shaping reality while often exacting a steep toll on the caster. Characters harness spells through skill checks, drawing upon their attributes and training in various magical disciplines. This chapter outlines the fundamentals of spellcasting, from basic mechanics to advanced techniques, resource management, and a comprehensive compendium of spells.

Note on terminology: DV is for attacks, DR is for checks and saves, and Armor is flat mitigation. Damage types like Force, Spectral, and Entropic have special interactions detailed in Chapters 5, 8, and 9.

## 5.1 Spell Categories and Tiers

Spells are divided into four primary categories, each with distinct flavors and applications:

- **Glyph Spells:** Quick-cast arcane inscriptions for battlefield traps, wards, or utility effects.
- **Blood Spells:** Fueled by vitae (blood) and sacrifice; potent but risky, manipulating life force directly.
- **Ritual Spells:** Extended invocations with lasting or narrative-altering effects, such as summoning spirits or consecrating land.
- **Forbidden Spells:** Reality-warping powers drawn from entropy, madness, or ancient Hylden lore, often risking Corruption.

Spells are further organized into four tiers based on character level and complexity:

- **Initiate Tier:** Levels 1–5 (basic effects, lower costs).
- **Adept Tier:** Levels 6–10 (moderate power, increased versatility).
- **Expert Tier:** Levels 11–15 (potent crowd control and high-impact effects).
- **Master Tier:** Levels 16–20 (epic, reality-altering magic).

## 5.2 Spellcasting Basics

- **Action to Cast:** Most spells require an Action, though some use a Bonus Action or Reaction as specified.
- **Concentration:** Certain spells demand ongoing focus. A caster can concentrate on only one spell at a time; starting a new one ends the previous. If damaged while concentrating, make a Concentration check (Will attribute + Concentration skill rank successes) against `DR 2`, or `DR 3` if a single hit dealt 5 or more damage, unless a spell or effect says otherwise. Concentration breaks if incapacitated or voluntarily ended (no action required).
- **Components:** Spells may require Somatic (S; gestures, needs a free hand), Verbal (V; incantations, needs clear speech), or Material (M; ingredients or foci, consumed unless noted otherwise).
- **Range and Targeting:** Spells specify range (e.g., touch, 30 feet) and targets (creatures, objects, areas, self). Line of sight and a clear path (line of effect) are usually required; obstructions like total cover block most spells.
- **Difficulty Ratings (DR):** Saving throws against spells use the listed DR. Unless a spell says otherwise, a combat spell's save DR equals its tier base plus the caster's relevant casting attribute modifier: Initiate 1, Adept 2, Expert 3, Master 4; add +0 if the casting attribute is 1-2, +1 if it is 3-4, or +2 if it is 5. A spell's DR is normally capped at 5 unless the spell or a specific feature says otherwise. Spells that list a specific DR use that as a **floor**, not a fixed value. If the formula above would produce a higher DR for your casting attribute, use the higher value.

### Save Types Quick Reference

When a spell lists a save (e.g., *DR 2 Blood save*), the target rolls **Attribute + one of the listed skills for that save type** vs. the DR. Do not substitute a different skill unless the spell explicitly tells you to.

| Save Type | Dice Pool | Resists |
|---|---|---|
| **Blood save** | Blood + Evasion or Unarmed Combat | Physical effects: binding, poison, disease, bodily manipulation, knockback |
| **Will save** | Will + Concentration or Insight | Mental effects: fear, charm, confusion, psychic intrusion, concentration breaks |
| **Soul save** | Soul + Concentration or Forbidden Knowledge | Spiritual effects: soul drain, corruption, death magic, spectral possession |
| **Evasion save** | Shadow + Evasion | Dodge effects: area blasts, traps, cones, sweeping ground hazards |
| **Fury save** | Fury + Weapon Mastery or Unarmed Combat | Raw force: breaking bonds, resisting a shove or knockback by brute strength |

*When a spell names an attribute directly (e.g., "Soul attribute"), it should also name the defending skill. If it does not, use the default skill pairing from the save table above.*

## 5.3 The Spellcasting Process

1. **Choose the Spell:** Select from your known or prepared list. Review type, casting time, cost, range, duration, components, and requirements.
2. **Determine Spell Type & Required Roll:**
   - **Core Dice Mechanic:** Roll D6s equal to Attribute + Skill rank; successes are 5s or 6s.
   - **Attack Spells:** Roll Attribute + Spellcasting Skill (e.g., Soul + Rituals) vs. target's Defense Value (DV). Spell attacks count as attacks for Combat Bonus and similar effects unless a source says otherwise. Successes ≥ DV hit.
   - **Save-Based Spells:** Target rolls Attribute + one of the spell's listed defending skills vs. the spell's DR. Unless a spell says otherwise, use the tier-and-attribute DR rule from Section 5.2.
   - **Utility/Ritual Spells:** May require a caster skill check vs. GM-set DR or auto-succeed if conditions met.
   - **Forbidden Spells:** Often use high DR saves (3–4+); may require or allow Corruption Dice.
3. **Spend Resources:**
   - **Blood Points (BP):** For Blood spells; costs 1–3+ based on tier. Regain via **feeding**, **blood relics** (see Ch. 7), or **blood rituals** performed during a short or long rest.
   - **Soul Energy (SE):** For Glyph, Ritual, Forbidden spells; costs 1 (Initiate) to 4+ (Master). Regain via rest or sources.
   - **Corruption Dice (CD):** Some Forbidden spells and desperate pushes use Corruption Dice; resolve them using Section 5.5 and Chapter 8.
   - Other costs: HP sacrifice, Concentration, or specific materials.
4. **Resolve the Effect:** Apply damage, conditions, or changes. Extra successes enable stunts (e.g., +damage, status effects, precision).
5. **Apply Corruption (If Applicable):** Resolve any listed Corruption cost, Corruption Dice, or push effect after the spell resolves.

## 5.4 Advanced Spell Mechanics

- **Area of Effect (AoE):** Affects shapes like radii or cones; targets save to halve/negate. No attack roll needed for point-targeted AoE. AoE spells that do not specify targeting affect **all creatures** in the area, including allies, unless the spell text says 'creatures of your choice,' 'enemies,' or 'allies.' If a spell says 'creatures' without qualification, it hits everything.
- **Resistances and Immunities:** Resistance halves damage after the relevant Armor interaction. Immunity negates the damage or effect entirely. Effects that bypass Resistance do not bypass Immunity unless they say so explicitly. Corrupted beings may still be vulnerable to holy effects if a source grants that weakness.
- **Critical Spell Effects:** Attack rolls with 3+ successes or exceeding DV by 2+ deal bonus damage, inflict status, or trigger spell-specific effects.
- **Mastery Piercing (Armor Gate):** To ensure high-level magic remains effective against the most heavily armored foes, all **Master Tier** spells and **Signature Upgrades** (from class features) automatically ignore up to 3 points of a target's Armor. Additionally, any spell that achieves 4+ successes on its casting roll ignores 2 points of Armor regardless of its tier. These effects stack if both conditions are met.
- **Mastery Bypass (Resistance/Immunity):** **Master Tier** spells and **Signature Upgrades** are exceptionally potent. They automatically ignore **Resistance** to their damage types. Furthermore, they treat **Immunity** as **Resistance** (taking half damage instead of none), unless the target has a specific feature stating it is immune even to Master-tier magic.
- **Spell Damage Scaling:** Damaging spell attacks and instantaneous combat spells follow the game's normal damaging-ability scaling unless a spell says otherwise. Ongoing hazards, persistent auras, summons, and long-form rituals do not gain this automatic scaling unless their text explicitly says they do. This asymmetry is intentional — ongoing auras are designed for tactical setup and area control, not sustained damage scaling.
- **Combat Control Durations:** As a baseline, a combat spell that denies actions, spellcasting, movement, or targeting should either last no longer than 3 rounds, require Concentration, or allow an end-of-turn repeat save. Longer lockouts should generally be reserved for rituals, scene powers, or spells that clearly state an exceptional cost or restriction.
- **Spell Duration:** Instantaneous, rounds/minutes, concentration-based, or permanent until dispelled.

## 5.5 Corruption Dice in Spellcasting

Corruption Dice (CD) in spellcasting represent a caster drawing on unstable, soul-rending power. Unlike corrupted perks, spells only use CD when a spell explicitly says so or when a caster chooses to push a Forbidden spell.

- **Spell-Specific Costs:** If a spell says to gain Corruption or roll Corruption Dice, resolve that exactly as written in the spell and apply the result after the spell finishes resolving.
- **Pushing a Forbidden Spell:** Once per spell cast, after rolling a Forbidden spell attack or caster check and before the outcome is finalized, you may push the spell by rolling `1 Corruption Die`. Reroll any number of non-successes from your original roll and keep the new results.
- **Risk:** Each `1` rolled on Corruption Dice increases your Corruption by 1. Apply this using the current Corruption rules in Chapter 8.
- **Limits:** You cannot push a spell that has already been pushed, and pushing a spell never changes its range, duration, area, or target restrictions unless the spell says otherwise.
- **Design Rule:** If a Forbidden spell already has a listed Corruption cost, that listed cost is the primary balancing lever. Optional pushing exists to let casters gamble for reliability, not to replace the spell's normal risk.

## 5.6 Reactions to Spells

Use your single Reaction per round to respond:

- **Counterspell** (Reaction): Available to any character who can cast spells. Cost: 1 SE. Trigger: You see a creature within 60 feet begin casting a spell. Roll your relevant casting Attribute + Magical Skill (e.g., Soul + Glyphcasting, Will + Forbidden Knowledge). Contested against the caster's roll or, for non-attack spells, against the spell's DR. On a success, the spell is disrupted and fails. The SE cost is lost regardless of outcome.
- **Evasion:** Shadow/Will + Evasion to halve/negate AoE effects.
- **Absorb:** Will + Concentration to reduce damage or negate status post-hit.
- **Spell-Specific:** Perks may grant unique reactions.

## 5.7 Resource Pools

- **Soul Energy (SE):** Maximum = 3 + Will attribute + (Character Level / 2, rounded up). Start combat at maximum; regain via rest, soul shards, or channeling.
  - **SE Regeneration:** SE restores fully after a **long rest**. **Soul shards** (found as treasure or crafted by Glyphwrights) restore 1–2 SE as an Action (see Ch. 7 §7.X). **Channeling** at an Energy Foci (Ch. 11 §11.3) restores 1 SE after a successful attunement check during a short rest.
- **Blood Points (BP):** Maximum = 4 + Shadow attribute + (Character Level / 2, rounded up). Start combat at maximum (if not starved); regain via **feeding**, **blood relics** (see Ch. 7), or **blood rituals** performed during a short or long rest. **While in the Spectral Realm:** BP is suspended — it cannot be spent and abilities requiring it cannot be activated. Your BP pool is preserved intact and becomes available again when you return to the Material Realm. See [Chapter 11, Section 11.5.6](./11_Realms-Terrain-Arcane-Power.md#1156-spectral-action-restrictions).
  - **BP Regeneration:** BP restores fully after a **long rest** during which the character can feed. **Feeding** on a living or recently dead (within 1 hour) creature restores BP equal to half that creature's TV, rounded up, as an Action. Feeding on a willing creature restores 1 BP and takes 1 minute. **Relics** that restore BP are listed in Ch. 7 §7.X.
  - **Spectral Restriction:** Sangromancers are wholly Material-realm casters. Their spells require living blood and cannot function in the Spectral Realm. A Sangromancer who crosses the veil retains their BP pool but cannot access it until they return to the Material Realm.
- **Max HP Recovery:** Permanent maximum HP reduction (from Master-tier Blood spells) can only be restored by a **Soulforge Resurrection** ritual performed on the affected character (restoring all lost max HP), or by a **long rest** at a location with healing properties designated by the GM (restoring 1 lost max HP). Temporary max HP reduction (like Glyph of Ruin) cannot reduce a character's current HP below 1 — if a creature's max HP would drop below their current HP, their current HP drops to match the new maximum.

## 5.8 Defining a "Scene" in Spellcasting

A "scene" is a distinct narrative segment (e.g., combat encounter, social negotiation, exploration of a chamber). Abilities limited to "once per scene" refresh when the GM declares a new scene begins. If an effect repeats each minute, resolve it at the end of each full minute unless the source says otherwise.

## 5.9 Learning and Preparing Spells

- **Class Lists:** Spell access is class-based and curated. A spell-using class gains access only to the spells, schools, or tags listed in its class entry.
- **Known vs. Prepared Spells:** A class either knows spells permanently or prepares them from its class list, as stated in the class entry. If a class entry does not say otherwise, treat it as a known-spell caster.
- **Starting Spells:** Spell-using characters begin with a small set of tier-appropriate spells from their class list, as shown in their class entry.
- **Leveling Up:** When a class grants spell progression, learn one new spell from your class list that you are high enough tier to cast. A known-spell caster may also replace one known spell with another spell from a tier they can cast. A prepared caster instead expands the set of spells they may prepare.
- **Discovery:** Learn via scrolls, tomes, mentors, or glyphs. Requires skill check (e.g., Will + Forbidden Knowledge) and downtime/resources (GM sets DR based on tier/rarity).

## 5.10 Spell Compendium

This compendium lists spells by tier and category. Chapter 3 assigns class access through curated class spell lists. Costs assume SE for Glyph, Ritual, and Forbidden spells, and BP for Blood spells. Casting time is 1 Action unless specified otherwise. Unless a spell says otherwise, save-based combat spells use the DR model in Section 5.2, spell attacks count as attacks for Combat Bonus, and damaging spell attacks or instantaneous combat spells scale using the normal damaging-ability rule. Spells that list a specific DR use that as a **floor**, not a fixed value. If the §5.2 formula would produce a higher DR for your casting attribute, use the higher value. The listed DR represents the minimum a caster of that tier achieves.

When a class feature and a spell share a name, treat the Chapter 5 spell as the generic base version of that technique. The class feature is that class's **Signature Upgrade**. If an ability, perk, or class feature references the named class feature, use the class-feature text. Learning or preparing the generic spell does not grant the Signature Upgrade.

**Access Tags:** `SR` = Soul Reaver, `SM` = Shadowmancer, `SG` = Sangromancer, `GW` = Glyphwright, `WB` = Warden of Balance, `HW` = Hylden Warlock.

### 5.10.1 Initiate Tier (Levels 1–5)

#### Glyph Spells
- **Glyph of Anchoring** [GW, SR, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; lasts until triggered or until your next long rest. Choose a 5-ft square adjacent to the inscribed surface. The first creature that attempts to teleport or shift realms (see [Chapter 11, Section 11.5.2](./11_Realms-Terrain-Arcane-Power.md#1152-crossing-the-veil)) into, out of, or through that square triggers the glyph and must succeed on a DR 2 Will save or the teleport/shift fails and the action, spell, or effect is wasted. Because glyphs affect both realms simultaneously (Ch. 11 §11.5.3), this glyph also blocks realm-shift crossing attempts at Soul Portals from the Spectral side. A Spectral creature attempting to use a Soul Portal in the affected square must still succeed on the DR 2 Will save or the crossing fails.
- **Glyph of Binding Light** [GW, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; triggers on approach. DR 2 Evasion save or **Restrained** 1 round.
- **Glyph of Delay** [GW]: Cost: 0 SE (modifies another glyph). Delays trigger by 1 round.
- **Glyph of Detection** [GW, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. 1 minute to cast; touch; lasts 1 hour. Choose one category such as Undead, active magic, or a specific lineage. The glyph alerts you mentally the first time a creature, object, or effect of that type comes within 15 ft of it.
- **Glyph of Flame** [GW]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; triggers on approach. 3 Elemental (Fire) damage in 5-ft radius (DR 2 Evasion halves).
- **Glyph of Frost** [GW]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; triggers on approach. 1 Elemental (Cold) damage + speed -10 ft 1 round (DR 2 Fury negates speed reduction).
- **Glyph of Sparks** [GW]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; triggers on approach. 1 Elemental (Lightning) damage + DR 2 Will save or **Blinded** 1 round.
- **Glyph of Thorns** [GW, SR]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; triggers on entry. 2 Spectral damage + DR 2 Evasion save or speed halved 1 round.
- **Glyph of Warding** [GW, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch; lasts until triggered or until your next long rest. Choose a passphrase and one minor rider when you cast it: flash, tether, or shock. A creature that touches or deliberately interacts with the warded object without the passphrase triggers the glyph, alerting you if you are on the same plane and applying the chosen rider: **flash** forces a DR 2 Will save or the creature is **Blinded** until the end of its next turn, **tether** reduces its speed to 0 (**Rooted**) until the end of its next turn, or **shock** deals 1 Elemental (Lightning) damage.

#### Blood Spells
- **Blood Leash** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 30 ft; DR 2 Blood save or tethered (**Restrained**; max 15 ft away) for concentration up to 1 min.
- **Blood Mark** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 30 ft; one creature you can see. Until the end of your next turn, the first attack made against the target each round has Advantage. If you touch a willing target while casting instead of targeting at range, the mark lasts until the end of the scene rather than until the end of your next turn.
- **Blood Thread** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 30 ft; create a visible, sticky blood-filament up to 15 ft long between two points or from your hand to one unattended object. The thread lasts for 10 minutes, can support negligible weight, and can be used as a tripwire, simple tether, or for manipulating Tiny unattended objects within range. A creature moving through the thread deliberately can do so freely; a creature that blunders through it triggers the thread and reveals its position to you if you are within 60 ft.
- **Blood Trace** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 1 min cast; sense direction/distance to blood sample's owner for 10 min.
- **Coagulate** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Touch; end **Bleeding** or stabilize dying target.
- **Crimson Slash** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Self/15 ft; form blade (3 Physical (Slashing) + standard **Bleeding**) or whip (2 Physical (Slashing) + DR 2 Evasion or standard **Bleeding**).
- **Hemostatic Pulse** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Touch; heal 2 HP. A creature can benefit from Hemostatic Pulse only once per minute — casting it again on the same target before that time has elapsed has no effect.
- **Minor Bloodshield** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Bonus Action or Reaction when you or a creature within 30 ft takes damage; the target gains temporary HP equal to `3 + your Soul`, applied before the triggering damage if cast as a Reaction. A creature can benefit from only one Minor Bloodshield at a time.
- **Pulse Spike** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 30 ft; spell attack, 3 Spectral damage + DR 2 Blood save or Disadvantage on the target's next two attack rolls or checks.
- **Sanguine Dart** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. 30 ft; spell attack, 3 Physical (Piercing) with Advantage if the target is **Bleeding**.

#### Ritual Spells
- **Altar Blessing** [WB]: Cost: 2 SE. 10 minutes; touch an altar, shrine, or dedicated sacred focus; lasts 24 hours. Choose one blessing when you cast it: **Guidance** gives each creature that prays there once during the duration Advantage on one relevant Will, Soul, Rituals, or Insight check, or **Mercy** causes the first magical healing that creature receives within 1 hour of prayer to restore +1 HP. Each creature can gain the blessing only once per casting.
- **Bind Soul** [SR, WB, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. 10 minutes; touch one willing creature or one corpse that died within the last hour; duration special. You bind a fragment of the target's soul into a prepared vessel you touch during the casting. The vessel can hold the fragment until your next long rest. While stored, the fragment can be used as a narrative proof of identity, a component for another rite that names it, or a safeguard against effects that would fully annihilate that soul, at GM discretion.
- **Breath of Ancients** [WB, SR]: Cost: 2 SE. 10 minutes; self at a historical site or scene of powerful emotion; instantaneous. You receive a brief, symbolic vision of one significant past event tied to that location, usually no more than a minute of sensory impressions. The GM should provide at least one actionable clue, but the vision may be incomplete, metaphorical, or emotionally distorted.
- **Echo Word** [GW, SM]: Cost: 1 SE. 1 minute; touch; inscribe a tiny glyph on a surface or object and speak a phrase of up to 10 words. Choose a trigger: proximity (creature within 5 ft), a specific sound, or a keyword. When triggered, the glyph emits your recorded voice speaking the phrase at its original volume, then vanishes. Lasts until triggered or until your next long rest.
- **Lantern Rite** [SR, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. Self; 30-foot light reveals **Invisible** or **Incorporeal** creatures for Concentration, up to 10 minutes.
- **Memory Script** [GW, SM]: Cost: 1 SE. 1 minute; touch; inscribe invisible script of up to 100 words onto a surface or object you touch. The script is revealed to a viewer who speaks the chosen keyword within 1 foot of the surface. The script lasts until your next long rest unless you spend 1 additional SE when casting to make it permanent. For a permanent script, the casting time is 10 minutes.
- **Rite of Stone** [GW, WB]: Cost: 2 SE. 10 minutes; touch one stone surface or stone container; lasts 24 hours. Choose one mode: **reinforce** grants the object or a 5-foot stone section +3 effective HP against mundane damage, **alarm** causes the stone to emit an audible crack when a creature disturbs it, or **cache** conceals one Tiny object within the stone, requiring a DR 2 Observation or DR 2 Glyphcasting check to find.
- **Soul Flicker** [SR, SM]: Cost: 1 SE. Self; until the start of your next turn, all attacks against you are made with Disadvantage. While this effect is active, you cannot make attack rolls, cast damaging spells, or take any action that directly targets another creature with harm.
- **Spirit Echo** [SR, SM, WB, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 1 min; self; make a Soul + Observation or Soul + Forbidden Knowledge check (DR 1). On a success, sense the number and general emotional state of spiritual traces in a 30-ft area. On a failure, sense only that spiritual traces are or are not present.
- **Warding Circle** [GW, WB]: Cost: 2 SE. 1 min; 10-ft circle; choose one creature type (e.g., Undead, Beast, Mortal). Creatures of that type cannot enter the circle or target those inside with melee attacks. Allies inside the circle gain +1 die to saves against the chosen type's abilities. Lasts 1 hour.

#### Forbidden Spells
- **Blind Insight** [HW, WB]: Cost: 1 SE and roll 1 Corruption Die. 1 minute; self; duration instantaneous. Ask the GM one question about the most immediate serious danger facing you, your allies, or your current objective. The answer must be truthful but may arrive as a symbolic omen, fragment, or sensory shock rather than plain language.
- **Dissonant Pulse** [HW, WB]: Cost: 1 SE. Self; 10-ft radius. Creatures of your choice in the area that are concentrating on a spell or sustained effect must make a DR 2 Will save. On a failure, their concentration ends and they have Disadvantage on the next Concentration or Focus-based check they make before the end of their next turn. On a success, they keep concentration but still suffer Disadvantage on that next check.
- **Echo of Rot** [HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 30 feet; DR 2 Blood save or halved healing + decay odor for 3 rounds.
- **Eldritch Gasp** [HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 15-ft cone; DR 2 Blood save or 1 Spectral damage + **Silenced** 1 round.
- **Glyph Disruptor** [GW, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 30 ft; Soul + Forbidden vs. DR to dispel glyph.
- **Hex of Pain** [SM, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 30 ft; DR 2 Will save or suffer Disadvantage on attacks and checks for 1 round.
- **Minor Rift** [SR, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 30 ft; choose one unattended object of up to 20 pounds or one 5-ft square you can see. Either pull the object up to 10 ft in a straight line toward you, or tear open unstable space in the square until the start of your next turn, making it difficult terrain.
- **Nightmare Seed** [SM, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. Touch sleeping; nightmares deny rest + DR 2 Will or **Frightened** for up to 1 minute. The target may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
- **Shadow Infestation** [SM, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. 30 ft; DR 2 Will save or suffer Disadvantage on Observation checks in dim light for 1 min.
- **Whispershade** [SR, SM, HW]: Cost: 1 SE. Bonus; 60 ft; one-way telepathic whispers for concentration 1 min.

### 5.10.2 Adept Tier (Levels 6–10)

#### Glyph Spells
- **Glyph of Binding** [GW, WB]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on entry; DR 2 Evasion or **Restrained** for Soul rounds (up to 3 targets).
- **Glyph of Chains** [GW, WB, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on large creature; DR 3 Blood or **Restrained** + no teleport 1 minute. A Restrained creature may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
- **Glyph of Cinders** [GW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on approach; creatures in the 10-foot area take 2 Elemental (Fire) damage at the start of each turn for 3 rounds + difficult terrain.
- **Glyph of Displacement** [GW, SM, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on touch; DR 2 **Evasion** or teleport 15 feet random.
- **Glyph of Echoes** [GW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; inscribe a mirroring glyph adjacent to an existing Initiate or Adept glyph you can see. 1 round after the original glyph triggers, the Glyph of Echoes triggers with the same effect, but its damage, area, and duration are all halved. If the original glyph had no variable values, it simply repeats once.
- **Glyph of Entropy** [GW, SM, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on entry or spellcast; the target must succeed on a DR 2 Will save or its active magic is disrupted. If it was casting a spell, the spell fails. Additionally, one piece of mundane equipment the target is using gains an **Equipment Flaw** for 1 minute: a weapon deals -1 damage, or armor provides -1 Armor mitigation.
- **Glyph of Quicksand** [GW, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch earth; triggers on entry; DR 2 Blood or **Restrained** in 15x15 foot area + 1 Corruption if sunk.
- **Glyph of Severance** [GW, SR, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on touch; 4 Spectral damage + DR 2 Blood or sever non-magical item.
- **Glyph of Silence** [GW, SM, WB]: Cost: 2 SE. Touch; triggers on sound/entry; 10-foot silence (**Silenced**) 1 minute.
- **Shatter Sigil** [GW, HW]: Cost: 2 SE. 30 feet; Soul + Glyphcasting vs. DR to dispel glyph safely.

#### Blood Spells
- **Bleeding Curse** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. 30 feet; DR 3 Will or, for 1 minute while you maintain concentration, any Physical damage the target takes also inflicts standard **Bleeding**.
- **Blood Mirror** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. Reaction on damage; reflect half damage as Spectral damage to attacker.
- **Blood Puppet** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. 30 feet; one **Bleeding** creature you can see. DR 2 Will save. On a failure, you control the target's movement, action, and bonus action on its next turn, but you cannot force it to take an obviously suicidal action. On a success, the spell fails. The Sangromancer's **Blood Puppet** class feature is the Signature Upgrade of this spell.
- **Blood Scent** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Bonus; self; detect **Bleeding** or Bloodied creatures within 60 feet for 10 minutes.
- **Crimson Bind** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet. Creatures of your choice in the area must make a DR 2 Blood save or Evasion save. On a failure, a creature is **Rooted** until the end of its next turn and then has its speed halved (**Slowed**) for a number of rounds equal to your Soul, to a maximum of 3 rounds total. On a success, its speed is halved (**Slowed**) until the end of its next turn. The Sangromancer's **Crimson Bind** class feature is the Signature Upgrade of this spell.
- **Crimson Mantle** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. Bonus; self; +1 Armor 1 minute + attacker DR 2 Will or Disadvantage on their next attack.
- **Echo Wound** [SG]: Cost: 1 BP. Reaction on enemy healing; half healed as Physical damage + healer DR 2 Will or 1 Corruption.
- **Hemorrhage Halo** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. Self; 10-foot radius; creatures of your choice in the area make a DR 2 Blood save or take 2 Spectral damage plus standard **Bleeding**.
- **Sangral Lance** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. 60-foot line; spell attack, 5 Physical (Piercing) + DR 2 Blood or standard **Bleeding**; pierce second target on extra successes.
- **Vital Hook** [SG]: Cost: 2 BP. 30 feet; spell attack, 2 Spectral damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DR 2 Blood save or be pulled 10 feet toward you. While you maintain Concentration (up to 1 minute), the target is tethered — at the start of each of your turns you may pull the tethered target 10 feet toward you as a free effect (no additional save).

#### Ritual Spells

Choose one mode when cast: **lash** makes a spell attack against one creature and deals 5 Spectral damage on a hit, or **line** forces creatures in a 15-ft-long, 5-ft-wide line to make a DR 2 Evasion save, taking 3 Spectral damage on a failure or half as much on a success.

#### Ritual Spells
- **Binding of the Starborn** [WB]: Cost: 5 SE. 1 hr under open sky at a site of ancient power; you call upon a **Bound Guardian** — an ancient pre-Vampire spirit once tasked with protecting a sacred place or object. The spirit manifests to perform one task within its domain (DR 4 Soul + Ritualism). It is not benevolent; it is bound. It will fulfill the letter of your request but resents the summons. It departs when the task is complete or at dawn, whichever comes first.
- **Chrono Collapse** [WB, HW]: Cost: 5 SE. 1 min; 20-ft radius in 120 ft; DR 4 Will save or limited actions 3 rounds. A target with limited actions may take only one Action or one Bonus Action on each of its turns (not both), and cannot take Reactions. Movement is unaffected.

Choose one effect: **Unbreachable** (the surface cannot be damaged by mundane means and its DR to breach with magic is 5), **Dimensional Lock** (teleportation and realm-shifting through the sigil fail automatically), or **Elemental Bane** (choose one damage type; creatures in a 10-ft radius have Resistance to that type, or if it is a hostile sigil, they take 2 damage of that type when they enter the area). A sigil can be removed only by a Master-tier Glyphwright using Glyph of Unmaking.
- **Invocation of Chains** [WB, HW]: Cost: 4 SE. 20-ft radius in 60 ft; DR 4 Evasion save or become Restrained while you maintain Concentration, up to 3 rounds.

- **Realmshift** [SR, WB, HW]: Cost: 5 SE. 10 min; 60-ft overlay Spectral/other plane (DR 3 Soul + Ritualism per min). This spell overlays the Spectral Realm across an area rather than shifting individual creatures. Glyph of Anchoring glyphs within the area do not trigger against Realmshift's overlay — it is not a creature shifting realms. However, any creature who attempts to voluntarily cross the veil within the Realmshift area must still contend with active Anchoring glyphs. See [Chapter 11, Section 11.5](./11_Realms-Terrain-Arcane-Power.md#115-the-spectral-realm-full-rules) for rules on overlapping realms.
- **Ritual of Eclipse** [SM, WB, HW]: Cost: 5 SE. 10 minutes; you call forth a localized eclipse in a 1-mile radius centered on your location, lasting 1 hour. The area is plunged into Dim Light. Creatures that gain bonuses or regain HP from sunlight (such as certain Vampires or Mortals) lose those benefits and suffer -1 die to all rolls while in the eclipse. Spells with the [SM] tag or that deal Shadow/Spectral damage gain +1 die to damage rolls while cast within the area.
- **Soulforge Resurrection** [SG, WB, HW]: Cost: 5 SE or 5 BP (choose based on your primary casting resource; a Sangromancer pays 5 BP, all other classes pay 5 SE). 8 hrs; revive with full faculties (DR 4 Soul + Ritualism).

The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the **Paralyzed** condition on a success. If the target fails this save three times before the spell ends, it is also banished to an adjacent realm (see [Chapter 11, §11.5.5](./11_Realms-Terrain-Arcane-Power.md#1155-forced-realm-shifts)) until the end of its next turn. This banishment is controlled — the target does not suffer the standard forced-shift shock damage from §11.5.5. Legendary creatures are immune to this banishment rider.
- **Black Spiral** [HW]: Cost: 5 SE and gain 1 Corruption, then roll 2 Corruption Dice. 20-ft radius in 60 ft; creatures in the area take 5 Entropic (Void) damage and are pulled up to 10 ft toward the center.
