# Chapter 5: Spellcasting in Nosgoth

Magic in Nosgoth is a volatile fusion of soul force, elemental essence, and corrupted power. It serves as both a tool and a curse, capable of shaping reality while often exacting a steep toll on the caster. Characters harness spells through skill checks, drawing upon their attributes and training in various magical disciplines. This chapter outlines the fundamentals of spellcasting, from basic mechanics to advanced techniques, resource management, and a comprehensive compendium of spells.

Note on terminology: DV is for attacks, DR is for checks and saves, and Armor is flat mitigation. Damage types like Force, Spectral, and Entropic have special interactions detailed in Chapters 5, 8, and 9.

## 5.1 Spell Categories and Tiers

Spells are divided into four primary categories, each with distinct flavors and applications:

- **Glyph Spells:** Quick-cast arcane inscriptions for battlefield traps, wards, or utility effects.
- **Blood Spells:** Fueled by vitae (blood) and sacrifice; potent but risky, manipulating life force directly.
- **Ritual Spells:** Extended invocations with lasting or narrative-altering effects, such as summoning spirits or consecrating land.
- **Forbidden Spells:** Reality-warping powers drawn from entropy, madness, or ancient Hylden lore, often risking Corruption.

Spells are further organized into four tiers based on character level and complexity:

- **Initiate Tier:** Levels 1–5 (basic effects, lower costs).
- **Adept Tier:** Levels 6–10 (moderate power, increased versatility).
- **Expert Tier:** Levels 11–15 (potent crowd control and high-impact effects).
- **Master Tier:** Levels 16–20 (epic, reality-altering magic).

## 5.2 Spellcasting Basics

- **Action to Cast:** Most spells require an Action, though some use a Bonus Action or Reaction as specified.
- **Concentration:** Certain spells demand ongoing focus. A caster can concentrate on only one spell at a time; starting a new one ends the previous. If damaged while concentrating, make a Concentration check (Will attribute + Concentration skill rank successes vs. a DR based on the damage or situation). Concentration breaks if incapacitated or voluntarily ended (no action required).
- **Components:** Spells may require Somatic (S; gestures, needs a free hand), Verbal (V; incantations, needs clear speech), or Material (M; ingredients or foci, consumed unless noted otherwise).
- **Range and Targeting:** Spells specify range (e.g., touch, 30 feet) and targets (creatures, objects, areas, self). Line of sight and a clear path (line of effect) are usually required; obstructions like total cover block most spells.
- **Difficulty Ratings (DR):** Saving throws against spells use the listed DR. Unless a spell says otherwise, a combat spell's save DR equals its tier base plus the caster's relevant casting attribute modifier: Initiate 1, Adept 2, Expert 3, Master 4; add +0 if the casting attribute is 1-2, +1 if it is 3-4, or +2 if it is 5. A spell's DR is normally capped at 5 unless the spell or a specific feature says otherwise.

### Save Types Quick Reference

When a spell lists a save (e.g., *DR 2 Blood save*), the target rolls **Attribute + one of the listed skills for that save type** vs. the DR. Do not substitute a different skill unless the spell explicitly tells you to.

| Save Type | Dice Pool | Resists |
|---|---|---|
| **Blood save** | Blood + Evasion or Unarmed Combat | Physical effects: binding, poison, disease, bodily manipulation, knockback |
| **Will save** | Will + Concentration or Insight | Mental effects: fear, charm, confusion, psychic intrusion, concentration breaks |
| **Soul save** | Soul + Concentration or Forbidden Knowledge | Spiritual effects: soul drain, corruption, death magic, spectral possession |
| **Evasion save** | Shadow + Evasion | Dodge effects: area blasts, traps, cones, sweeping ground hazards |
| **Fury save** | Fury + Weapon Mastery or Unarmed Combat | Raw force: breaking bonds, resisting a shove or knockback by brute strength |

*When a spell names an attribute directly (e.g., "Soul attribute"), it should also name the defending skill. If it does not, use the default skill pairing from the save table above.*

## 5.3 The Spellcasting Process

1. **Choose the Spell:** Select from your known or prepared list. Review type, casting time, cost, range, duration, components, and requirements.
2. **Determine Spell Type & Required Roll:**
   - **Core Dice Mechanic:** Roll D6s equal to Attribute + Skill rank; successes are 5s or 6s.
   - **Attack Spells:** Roll Attribute + Spellcasting Skill (e.g., Soul + Rituals) vs. target's Defense Value (DV). Spell attacks count as attacks for Combat Bonus and similar effects unless a source says otherwise. Successes ≥ DV hit.
   - **Save-Based Spells:** Target rolls Attribute + one of the spell's listed defending skills vs. the spell's DR. Unless a spell says otherwise, use the tier-and-attribute DR rule from Section 5.2.
   - **Utility/Ritual Spells:** May require a caster skill check vs. GM-set DR or auto-succeed if conditions met.
   - **Forbidden Spells:** Often use high DR saves (3–4+); may require or allow Corruption Dice.
3. **Spend Resources:**
   - **Blood Points (BP):** For Blood spells; costs 1–3+ based on tier. Regain via feeding or rituals.
   - **Soul Energy (SE):** For Glyph, Ritual, Forbidden spells; costs 1 (Initiate) to 4+ (Master). Regain via rest or sources.
   - **Corruption Dice (CD):** Add bonus dice to rolls but risk Corruption (see Section V).
   - Other costs: HP sacrifice, Concentration, or specific materials.
4. **Resolve the Effect:** Apply damage, conditions, or changes. Extra successes enable stunts (e.g., +damage, status effects, precision).
5. **Apply Corruption (If Applicable):** See Section V.

## 5.4 Advanced Spell Mechanics

- **Area of Effect (AoE):** Affects shapes like radii or cones; targets save to halve/negate. No attack roll needed for point-targeted AoE.
- **Resistances and Immunities:** Resistance halves damage after the relevant Armor interaction. Immunity negates the damage or effect entirely. Effects that bypass Resistance do not bypass Immunity unless they say so explicitly. Corrupted beings may still be vulnerable to holy effects if a source grants that weakness.
- **Critical Spell Effects:** Attack rolls with 3+ successes or exceeding DV by 2+ deal bonus damage, inflict status, or trigger spell-specific effects.
- **Mastery Piercing (Armor Gate):** To ensure high-level magic remains effective against the most heavily armored foes, all **Master Tier** spells and **Signature Upgrades** (from class features) automatically ignore up to 3 points of a target's Armor. Additionally, any spell that achieves 4+ successes on its casting roll ignores 2 points of Armor regardless of its tier. These effects stack if both conditions are met.
- **Spell Damage Scaling:** Damaging spell attacks and instantaneous combat spells follow the game's normal damaging-ability scaling unless a spell says otherwise. Ongoing hazards, persistent auras, summons, and long-form rituals do not gain this automatic scaling unless their text explicitly says they do.
- **Combat Control Durations:** As a baseline, a combat spell that denies actions, spellcasting, movement, or targeting should either last no longer than 3 rounds, require Concentration, or allow an end-of-turn repeat save. Longer lockouts should generally be reserved for rituals, scene powers, or spells that clearly state an exceptional cost or restriction.
- **Spell Duration:** Instantaneous, rounds/minutes, concentration-based, or permanent until dispelled.

## 5.5 Corruption Dice in Spellcasting

Corruption Dice (CD) tap perilous energies, especially for Forbidden spells or pushing limits.

- **Using CD:** Add to Forbidden spell rolls for potency or push failed rolls (reroll non-successes +1 CD).
- **Consequences:**
  - Each '1' on CD increases Corruption Level by 1.
  - At 3+ Corruption, '1's also trigger a 2d6 roll on the Corruption Dice Failure Table (e.g., Specter Cling: a hostile spirit attaches; Crimson Hunger: intense bloodlust; Eldritch Attention: draws otherworldly notice).
  - Escalating Corruption unlocks perks but imposes penalties (detailed in Corruption rules).

## 5.6 Reactions to Spells

Use your single Reaction per round to respond:

- **Counterspell:** Contested roll (Relevant Attribute + Magical Skill) vs. incoming spell's DR or caster's roll.
- **Evasion:** Shadow/Will + Evasion to halve/negate AoE effects.
- **Absorb:** Will + Concentration to reduce damage or negate status post-hit.
- **Spell-Specific:** Perks may grant unique reactions.

## 5.7 Resource Pools

- **Soul Energy (SE):** Maximum = 3 + Will attribute + (Character Level / 2, rounded up). Start combat at maximum; regain via rest, soul shards, or channeling.
- **Blood Points (BP):** Maximum = 4 + Blood attribute + (Character Level / 2, rounded up). Start combat at maximum (if not starved); regain via feeding or relics.

## 5.8 Defining a "Scene" in Spellcasting

A "scene" is a distinct narrative segment (e.g., combat encounter, social negotiation, exploration of a chamber). Abilities limited to "once per scene" refresh when the GM declares a new scene begins. If an effect repeats each minute, resolve it at the end of each full minute unless the source says otherwise.

## 5.9 Learning and Preparing Spells

- **Class Lists:** Spell access is class-based and curated. A spell-using class gains access only to the spells, schools, or tags listed in its class entry.
- **Known vs. Prepared Spells:** A class either knows spells permanently or prepares them from its class list, as stated in the class entry. If a class entry does not say otherwise, treat it as a known-spell caster.
- **Starting Spells:** Spell-using characters begin with a small set of tier-appropriate spells from their class list, as shown in their class entry.
- **Leveling Up:** When a class grants spell progression, learn one new spell from your class list that you are high enough tier to cast. A known-spell caster may also replace one known spell with another spell from a tier they can cast. A prepared caster instead expands the set of spells they may prepare.
- **Discovery:** Learn via scrolls, tomes, mentors, or glyphs. Requires skill check (e.g., Will + Forbidden Knowledge) and downtime/resources (GM sets DR based on tier/rarity).

## 5.10 Spell Compendium

This compendium lists spells by tier and category. Chapter 3 assigns class access through curated class spell lists. Costs assume SE for Glyph, Ritual, and Forbidden spells, and BP for Blood spells. Casting time is 1 Action unless specified otherwise. Unless a spell says otherwise, save-based combat spells use the DR model in Section 5.2, spell attacks count as attacks for Combat Bonus, and damaging spell attacks or instantaneous combat spells scale using the normal damaging-ability rule.

When a class feature and a spell share a name, treat the Chapter 5 spell as the generic base version of that technique. The class feature is that class's **Signature Upgrade**. If an ability, perk, or class feature references the named class feature, use the class-feature text. Learning or preparing the generic spell does not grant the Signature Upgrade.

**Access Tags:** `SR` = Soul Reaver, `SM` = Shadowmancer, `SG` = Sangromancer, `GW` = Glyphwright, `WB` = Warden of Balance, `HW` = Hylden Warlock.
