# Chapter 11: Realms, Terrain, and Arcane Power
In the shattered world of Nosgoth, the veil between the Material and Spectral Realms is thin, and the land itself pulses with ancient magic. This chapter details how your character’s Realm Affinity shapes their interaction with these realms, how Terrain Types influence movement and combat, and how Energy Foci amplify magical power. Together, these systems govern how you navigate the ruins, battlefields, and cursed places of Nosgoth, whether you’re a blood-hungry Vampire, a spectral Wraith, or a Glyph-marked wanderer caught between worlds.

## 11.1 Realm Affinity
### Overview
Every character in Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG is tied to one of two realms—or, in rare cases, both. Your Realm Affinity determines how you perceive and interact with the world, from the tangible stone and blood of the Material Realm to the ethereal whispers and hidden pathways of the Spectral Realm. Affinity shapes your strengths, weaknesses, and tactical options, making it a cornerstone of your character’s identity.
Affinity Types

Material: You are grounded in the physical world. You interact with objects and beings in the Material Realm normally, but cannot see or affect Spectral creatures or pathways without magic. Vampires, Sarafan warriors, and most mortals fall into this category.
Spectral: You exist primarily in the Spectral Realm. You can move through certain walls, see hidden truths, and interact with spirits—but struggle with physical objects and may require anchors (like glyphs or relics) to touch the Material world. Wraiths and certain undead are Spectral-affined.
Hybrid: You can shift between realms or interact with both to some extent. Hybrid characters (e.g., Wraiths with Glyph-marked traits or ancient vampires like Kain) can access both realms for brief periods, often gaining powerful tactical advantages. This affinity is rare and often comes with unique drawbacks.

Mechanical Implications

Spectral Movement: Spectral-affined characters can use abilities or stunts to ignore certain terrain (e.g., moving through walls or bypassing locks) at the GM’s discretion.
Targeting and Resistance: Spells or damage types (e.g., Spectral, Void) affect characters differently based on affinity. For example, Spectral creatures take double damage from holy relics but may resist Material-based attacks.
Visibility: Some enemies, artifacts, or pathways are only visible or interactable in one realm. A Material-affined character might walk past a Spectral glyph, unaware of its power, while a Spectral character could miss a Material trap.

Example: A Spectral Wraith slips through a crumbling wall to flank a Sarafan patrol, unseen in the Material Realm. Meanwhile, a Material-affined Vampire struggles to interact with a Spectral relic, requiring a Glyphcaster’s aid to unlock its power.
## 11.2 Terrain Types
### Overview
Nosgoth’s landscapes are as deadly as its inhabitants. From blood-soaked battlegrounds to spectral mists, terrain shapes every encounter. Terrain Types affect movement, combat, and strategy, and their effects often depend on your Realm Affinity. Understanding terrain is key to survival, whether you’re navigating the ash-choked ruins of Meridian or the corrupted marshes of the Termogent Forest.
Terrain Descriptions and Effects



Terrain Type
Description & Effects



Open Ground
Standard terrain. No modifiers to movement or combat. Examples: clear roads, flat stone floors.


Difficult Terrain
Costs 2 movement per tile. Examples: large rubble, snow, shallow water, broken stairs.


Hazardous Terrain
May deal damage or require a Difficulty Rating (DR) check to cross. Examples: fire, acid pools, spectral thorns (DR 2–4, depending on severity).


Elevated Terrain
Higher ground grants +1 DR against ranged attacks and +1 success on certain Awareness or combat rolls. Examples: hills, rooftops.


Cover
Half cover grants +1 DR, full cover grants +2 DR against ranged and spell attacks. Examples: walls, barrels, dense foliage.


Obscuring Terrain
Reduces line of sight; Stealth rolls gain +1 success when hiding. Examples: mist, darkness, ash clouds.


Spectral Terrain
Exists partially in the Spectral Realm. Non-Spectral entities need glyphs or special skills to interact with or move through it. Examples: ghostly bridges, spectral walls.


Corrupted Ground
Causes 1 stress or minor corruption with prolonged exposure (per scene). Certain perks grant immunity. Examples: Hylden-tainted soil, cursed altars.


Holy Ground
Deals 1 damage per round to undead or corrupted creatures. Boosts DR by 1 for holy casters or relics. Examples: consecrated shrines, Sarafan sanctums.


Bloodsoaked Terrain
Grants +1 success to Blood Mages’ rolls; may allow free Blood Point (BP) recovery once per scene if fed upon. Examples: battlefields, ritual sites.


Arcane Nexus
Magical energy foci. Reduce spell costs by 1 for casters attuned to the Nexus. Rare and volatile. Examples: Pillar remnants, ancient glyphs.


Interaction with Affinity

Material Affinity: Characters move and fight normally on Material-based terrain (e.g., Open Ground, Difficult Terrain) but may struggle with Spectral Terrain, requiring glyphs or Hybrid allies to interact.
Spectral Affinity: Characters can bypass some physical obstacles (e.g., moving through walls on Spectral Terrain) but may be unable to interact with Material objects without anchors.
Hybrid Affinity: Characters can adapt to both realms, gaining tactical advantages (e.g., using Spectral Terrain to ambush while retaining Material combat effectiveness).

Example: During a skirmish in the ruins of Avernus, a Blood Mage stands on Bloodsoaked Terrain, gaining +1 success on their spellcasting. A Spectral enemy uses Obscuring Terrain (mist) to hide, forcing the Mage to rely on a Hybrid ally to spot the foe.
## 11.3 Energy Foci
### Overview
An Energy Foci (plural: Foci) is a locus of concentrated magical power—a place, object, or formation where ambient arcane energy is naturally or supernaturally amplified. These Foci are often remnants of the Pillars of Nosgoth, spectral bleed-throughs, or Hylden constructs. Spellcasters can tap into Foci to enhance their magic, but doing so comes with risks.
Mechanical Benefits

Reduced Costs: Reduce spell Soul Energy or Blood Point cost by 1 (minimum 0) while casting from or within a Foci.
Enhanced Casting: Gain +1 success on spellcasting rolls if attuned to the Foci.
Special Effects: Some rare Foci allow forbidden or hybrid magic (e.g., spectral-blood casting) or serve as fast-travel nodes, ritual circles, or resurrection anchors in certain campaigns.

Drawbacks or Risks

Instability: Overuse can destabilize a Foci, causing magical surges, corruption waves, or temporary rifts to the Spectral Realm.
Contention: Many Foci are contested by factions like the Pale Accord or Sarafan, or guarded by wraiths or spirits.
Corruption: Casting forbidden spells at a Foci may trigger Corruption Threshold gains or attract ancient entities like the Elder God.

Example: The Cradle of GlyphfireDeep within the ruins of Avernus lies a circular chamber inscribed with shifting runes. Those who channel magic within this Foci do so at half cost—but each casting whispers a fragment of their soul into the Spectral Realm, risking 1 stress per cast unless they succeed on a Will + Rituals check (DR 3).
How to Attune to an Energy Foci
To harness a Foci’s power, a character must attune to it through a ritual process.
Basic Method

Be within range of the Foci (typically 1–2 tiles).
Spend one full round focusing uninterrupted.
Make a Will + Rituals or Spirit + Glyphcasting skill check.
The Difficulty Rating (DR) depends on the Foci’s potency:
Common: DR 2
Rare/Corrupted: DR 3
Ancient/Forbidden: DR 4+



Success Results



Successes
Effect



1 Success
Gain reduced spell cost while attuned.


2 Successes
Also gain +1 success on spell rolls.


3+ Successes
Additional bonus: e.g., restore 1 resource (Soul Energy or Blood Point) per cast or unlock a hidden Foci property.


Failure & Consequences
Failing the attunement roll may:

Inflict 1 corruption or stress.
Overload the Foci, making it unstable (unusable for 1 scene).
Attract attention from Spectral entities or nearby factions (e.g., Sarafan patrols).You can retry attunement after a long rest or by spending a Corruption Die.

Optional Rule: One Foci at a Time
Characters may only be attuned to one Foci at a time, unless they possess a rare Foci Conduit Relic or a perk like:“Anchor of the Arcane” – You may maintain two concurrent Foci attunements without backlash.
## 11.4 Integrating Realms, Terrain, and Foci
Synergies
The interplay of Realm Affinity, Terrain Types, and Energy Foci creates dynamic tactical opportunities:

A Hybrid character attunes to an Arcane Nexus on Spectral Terrain, casting a powerful spectral-blood spell to banish a wraith.
A Material-affined Vampire navigates Corrupted Ground to reach a Foci, relying on a Spectral ally to bypass a ghostly barrier.
A Blood Mage uses Bloodsoaked Terrain to recover Blood Points, then channels an Arcane Nexus to unleash a devastating spell.

GM Advice
When designing encounters, consider:

Terrain Challenges: Place Foci in Hazardous or Spectral Terrain to create puzzles or risks. For example, a Foci guarded by spectral thorns requires a Spectral or Hybrid character to access safely.
Faction Conflicts: Make Foci contested objectives, with Sarafan or Pale Accord forces vying for control, forcing players to fight or sneak to attune.
Narrative Stakes: Tie Foci to Nosgoth’s lore—e.g., a Foci tied to a fallen Pillar might destabilize if overused, triggering a rift that advances the campaign’s plot.
