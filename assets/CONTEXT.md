## Core System Summary

### Dice Mechanics
- **System:** D6 dice pool (Attribute + Skill)

### Advantage/Disadvantage System
- **Advantage:** Re-roll all failures (1-4), add new successes to total
- **Disadvantage:** Re-roll all successes (5-6), keep only new results

### Critical Mechanics
- **Critical Success:** 3+ successes or exceed DR by 2+ (skill checks only)
- **Critical Hit:** 3+ successes or exceed DV by 2+ (combat only)

---

## Corruption System

### Core Concept
"Power at a Price" - Characters can tap into corruption for enhanced abilities but risk losing themselves.

### Corruption Pool Mechanics
- **Pool Size:** 2× Corruption Level in d6
- **Must spend ALL pool dice each session**
- **Corruption Die Results:**
  - 1 = Taint (complication/drawback)
  - 2-4 = Neutral (no effect)
  - 5-6 = Success (adds to your roll)

### Corruption Levels & Thresholds
- **0-2:** Minimal corruption
- **3-6:** Tier 1 Corrupted Perks available
- **7-10:** Tier 2 Corrupted Perks available
- **11-15:** Tier 3 Corrupted Perks available

### Pushing Rolls
- Cost: (Corruption Level ÷ 3, rounded up) dice from Corruption Pool
- Adds successes but risks Taint results

### Purification Methods
1. **Rituals of Purification** - Rare, demanding rites requiring specific components
2. **Acts of Atonement** - Narrative actions aligned with balance
3. **NPC Aid** - Seek help from powerful beings
4. **Downtime Recovery** - Gradual reduction through rest in pure locations

---

## Resource Pools

### Soul Energy (SE)
- **Used by:** Soul-based casters
- **Formula:** 3 + Will + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **Purpose:** Casting spells, supernatural abilities

### Blood Points (BP)
- **Used by:** Vampires, Blood Knights, Sangromancers
- **Formula:** 4 + Shadow + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **Purpose:** Vampiric abilities, blood magic

### Hit Points (HP)
- **Varies by class**
- **Starting:** 8-12 HP
- **Per Level:** +4 to +6 HP
