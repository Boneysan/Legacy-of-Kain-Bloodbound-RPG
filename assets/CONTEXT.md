- **Disadvantage:** Re-roll all successes (5-6), keep only new results

### Critical Mechanics

## Corruption System

### Core Concept
"Power at a Price" - Characters can tap into corruption for enhanced abilities but risk losing themselves.

### Corruption Pool Mechanics
- **Pool Size:** 2× Corruption Level in d6
- **Must spend ALL pool dice each session**
- **Corruption Die Results:**
  - 1 = Taint (complication/drawback)
  - 2-4 = Neutral (no effect)
  - 5-6 = Success (adds to your roll)

### Corruption Levels & Thresholds
- **0-2:** Minimal corruption
- **3-6:** Tier 1 Corrupted Perks available (Bloodstained Sight, Spectral Whisper, Corrupted Surge)
- **7-10:** Tier 2 Corrupted Perks available (Veil of the Damned, Hunger's Blade, Hylden's Grasp, Soul Leech, Abyssal Echo, Corrupted Ferocity)
- **11-15:** Tier 3 Corrupted Perks available (Soulrend Dominion, Bloodforged Apotheosis, Hylden's Rift, Abyssal Pact, Wraith's Lament, Corrupted Ascension)

### Pushing Rolls
- Cost: (Corruption Level ÷ 3, rounded up) dice from Corruption Pool
- Adds successes but risks Taint results

### Purification Methods
1. **Rituals of Purification** - Rare, demanding rites requiring specific components and locations
2. **Acts of Atonement** - Significant narrative actions demonstrating change of heart
3. **NPC Aid** - Seek help from powerful beings (at steep price)
4. **Downtime Recovery** - Gradual reduction through meditation and focused contemplation

### Blood Points (BP)

- **Formula:** 4 + Shadow + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **Purpose:** Vampiric abilities, blood magic

### Hit Points (HP)
- **Varies by class**
- **Starting:** 8-12 HP
- **Per Level:** +4 to +6 HP
