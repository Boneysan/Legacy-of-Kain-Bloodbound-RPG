## Core System Summary

### Dice Mechanics

- **DV (Defense Value):** Used for combat attacks only (1 + higher of Shadow or Will)

### Advantage/Disadvantage System
- **Advantage:** Re-roll all failures (1-4), add new successes to total
- **Disadvantage:** Re-roll all successes (5-6), keep only new results

### Critical Mechanics
- **Critical Success:** 3+ successes or exceed DR by 2+ (skill checks only)
- **Critical Hit:** 3+ successes or exceed DV by 2+ (combat only)

---

## Corruption System

### Core Concept
"Power at a Price" - Characters can tap into corruption for enhanced abilities but risk losing themselves.

### Corruption Pool Mechanics
- **Pool Size:** 2× Corruption Level in d6
- **Must spend ALL pool dice each session**
- **Corruption Die Results:**
  - 1 = Taint (complication/drawback)
  - 2-4 = Neutral (no effect)
  - 5-6 = Success (adds to your roll)

### Corruption Levels & Thresholds
- **0-2:** Minimal corruption
- **3-6:** Tier 1 Corrupted Perks available (Bloodstained Sight, Spectral Whisper, Corrupted Surge)
- **7-10:** Tier 2 Corrupted Perks available (Veil of the Damned, Hunger's Blade, Hylden's Grasp, Soul Leech, Abyssal Echo, Corrupted Ferocity)
- **11-15:** Tier 3 Corrupted Perks available (Soulrend Dominion, Bloodforged Apotheosis, Hylden's Rift, Abyssal Pact, Wraith's Lament, Corrupted Ascension)

### Pushing Rolls
- Cost: (Corruption Level ÷ 3, rounded up) dice from Corruption Pool
- Adds successes but risks Taint results

### Purification Methods
1. **Rituals of Purification** - Rare, demanding rites requiring specific components and locations
2. **Acts of Atonement** - Significant narrative actions demonstrating change of heart
3. **NPC Aid** - Seek help from powerful beings (at steep price)
4. **Downtime Recovery** - Gradual reduction through meditation and focused contemplation

---

## Resource Pools

### Soul Energy (SE)
- **Used by:** Soul-based casters
- **Formula:** 3 + Will + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **Purpose:** Casting spells, supernatural abilities

### Blood Points (BP)
- **Used by:** Vampires, Blood Knights, Sangromancers
- **Formula:** 4 + Shadow + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **Purpose:** Vampiric abilities, blood magic

### Hit Points (HP)
- **Varies by class**
- **Starting:** 8-12 HP
- **Per Level:** +4 to +6 HP

### Manual Consistency Audit — Oct 31, 2025
- Standardized mitigation terminology across Monster Manual Chapters 01–06:
   - Replaced "Damage Reduction" in stat blocks with "Armor".
   - Converted DR used as mitigation (e.g., "DR 3 vs Physical") to "Armor" (e.g., "Armor 3 vs Physical").
   - Left DR used for Difficulty Rating (saves/checks) unchanged.
- Chapter 05 (Constructs & Automatons) specific fixes:
   - Normalized all Armor lines (e.g., Clockwork Knight, Sentinel, Golem, Automaton, Soul-Tower, Scribe, Drone).
   - Converted weak-point references from AC to DV (e.g., Sentinel core DV 8; Soul-Tower cores DV 7).
   - Replaced one stray "DC" with "DR" on Command Word Vulnerability (Golem).
   - Clarified Force damage bypass text (Glyph Blade now "ignores Physical Armor").
- Clarified a few trait/ability texts to reference Armor instead of DR (e.g., Runic Shielding, Reality Shell, Phase Shift table).
- Did not alter encounter balance or dice pools; changes are terminology-only.
- Retained narrative uses of "wounded" to mean below half HP; "Bleeding" remains the explicit status effect.
- Header styles in early chapters remain as originally authored (Attacks + Special Abilities), aligning with the Introduction’s allowance for mixed schema.
 - Verification checks: no remaining "Damage Reduction" strings in 01–06; Chapter 05 shows no "Armor … DR" patterns; no stray "AC"/"DC" remain; DR saves preserved.

### Player's Handbook — Header & Document Standardization — Oct 31, 2025
- Standardized chapter titles to "# Chapter N: Title" across Player's Handbook files (00–12).

   - Skills and Equipment: Added H1 and converted plain section labels to H2/H3/H4 as appropriate.
   - Combat (Ch. 9): Removed stray opening code fences and deleted closing draft note at tail; file renders cleanly.

### Lore — World Primer Atmospheric Enhancement — Oct 31, 2025

   - **Opening Hook:** Added iconic "History abhors a paradox" quote and immersive introduction establishing tone, setting, and central themes.
   - **Overview:** Expanded with sensory details (gray skies, iron-tasting air, abandoned villages, warning stones).
   - **Key Factions:** Transformed bullet points into atmospheric paragraphs with visual descriptions (Sarafan armor glowing with sigils, vampire politics as "dance of blood debts," Hylden influence causing metal to grow like cancer).
   - **Legendary Figures:** Created character portraits with physical descriptions, personality beats, and thematic resonance (Kain's light-drinking armor, Raziel's skeletal form, Moebius "smiles when he lies, which is always").
   - **Key Locations:** Added sensory atmosphere to each location (Pillars humming discordantly, Abyss tasting of salt and copper, Citadel as "monument to refusal").
   - **Regional Descriptions:** Expanded North/East/South/West regions with gothic imagery (avalanches carrying voices, children learning vampire silhouettes, fireflies leading travelers astray, wind carrying scent of ash and ambition).
   - **Timeline:** Converted bullet points into narrative paragraphs capturing stakes, motivations, and cyclical tragedy of each major event.
   - **Spectral Realm:** Added "What it feels like" section with visceral descriptions; dramatically expanded principles (Distortion, Perception, Interaction, Consequence) with unsettling details of disorientation, danger, and transformation.
