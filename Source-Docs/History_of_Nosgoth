üõ° Faction Codex
Sarafan Order ‚Äì Once protectors of mankind, the Sarafan are now fanatical enforcers wielding glyph magic and soul-binding technology. They seek to purge all vampirekind and enforce rigid order across Nosgoth. Their rebirth under Hylden influence corrupted their zealotry into something far more mechanical and unforgiving.
Scions of Kain ‚Äì The fragmented vampire clans sired by Kain. Once unified under his rule, they now war among themselves for territory, relics, and remnants of divine favor. Each clan possesses distinct mutations and bloodlines tied to their lieutenant progenitor.
Cult of the Wheel (Elder Devotees) ‚Äì Worshippers of the Elder God who believe the Wheel of Fate must turn eternally. They believe all rebellion is blasphemy and seek to capture or destroy those who defy fate. They operate in shadows, often hidden within cities and among the dead.
Pale Accord ‚Äì A reformist sect descended from the remnants of the Circle of Nine. They aim to master forbidden knowledge to rebuild Nosgoth‚Äôs lost balance. Though noble in some aims, many among them walk dangerously close to Hylden-aligned magic and glyph corruption.
Crimson Fracture ‚Äì A radical faction of evolved vampires with spectral resonance. Believing the only future lies in merging Spectral and Material Realms, they conduct horrific experiments and rituals to create ‚Äúunified forms.‚Äù Their ambitions threaten planar stability.
Hylden Remnants ‚Äì Scattered Hylden warlords and sleeper agents, some still trapped in hosts, others leading small cults or commanding ancient bio-mechanical constructs. Their goal remains the complete inversion of the Pillars and the end of spiritual order.
Outlands Guilds ‚Äì A loose network of mercenaries, traders, rogue glyphborn, and relic hunters. They hold no loyalty but to coin and survival. Still, their knowledge of ruined roads, spectral crossings, and buried artifacts makes them vital to any campaign.
üîÆ Prophecy Compilation
The Scion of Balance ‚Äì "One shall be given the choice: to fall for the world or rise against it. If he falls, the Pillars will stand. If he stands, the world will fall."
The Reflected Path ‚Äì "The blade shall drink the soul of the martyr, and through the blade shall truth awaken. One face, two fates‚Äîneither can walk forward until one bleeds into the other."
The Return of the Hylden Core ‚Äì "When metal sings and the sky weeps flame, the cursed children shall breach their cage. Only when nine voices become one again shall their gate be sealed."
The Abyssal Heart ‚Äì "Buried beneath truth and beyond death, the Heart calls to those forgotten by gods and time. To wield it is to defy all fate‚Äîto break the wheel or remake it."
The Silent Moons ‚Äì "When the twin moons stand still, and the stars refuse their dance, Nosgoth‚Äôs soul shall be judged by the Echo of the First Betrayal."
The Wheel‚Äôs Undoing ‚Äì "A soul devours a god, and thus ends the turning. Bound no longer, the dead shall choose their rest."
Blood Without End ‚Äì "The river shall run red, not from war but from hunger. When blood is no longer taken but given freely, the curse shall be reborn."
The One Who Waits Upside Down ‚Äì "Beneath the Spectral horizon, a prisoner stirs. Neither god nor ghost, it waits for the key hidden in the lie of resurrection."
The Final Glyph ‚Äì "Nine lines, one circle. Carve it where light cannot reach. Speak it when silence reigns. Only then shall the lock break."
Prophets of Dust ‚Äì "Those who breathe the ash of the Pillars will dream true. In their madness lies the map to what was never written."
Nosgoth, a land suspended between divinity and damnation, was once a harmonious world shaped by the twin forces of spirit and matter. It thrived under the guidance of the Ancient Ones, a vampiric race chosen to uphold balance through the Pillars of Nosgoth.
These Pillars, nine mystical obelisks, represented core principles such as Mind, Nature, Conflict, and Time. Their magic ensured the stability of the realm and empowered the Circle of Nine‚Äîmortals imbued with responsibility to uphold each Pillar‚Äôs influence.
In opposition to the Ancients stood the Hylden, a race of fierce intellect and unyielding ambition. Unlike the spiritual Ancients, the Hylden worshiped free will and technological ascension, rejecting the Pillars and the Wheel of Fate that bound all souls.
The war between the Ancients and the Hylden was long and cataclysmic. Ultimately, the Ancients prevailed and exiled the Hylden to a dimension of torment. In their final act, the Hylden cursed the Ancients with vampirism‚Äîgranting immortality at the cost of sterility and a thirst for blood.
With the Hylden banished and the Ancients transformed, the vampires became the inheritors of Nosgoth. But their rule was neither just nor eternal. Over centuries, vampiric society fragmented, and the Pillars began to falter, corrupted from within.
The Circle of Nine, once protectors of balance, fell to madness and betrayal. Their connection to the Pillars weakened. The death of Ariel, guardian of the Pillar of Balance, shattered the harmony, leaving the Pillars vulnerable to rot and spiritual decay.
Into this fragile world came Kain‚Äîa mortal noble assassinated and resurrected as a vampire by the necromancer Mortanius. Kain‚Äôs quest for vengeance led him to discover his destiny: to become the Scion of Balance and choose between self-sacrifice or dominion.
Kain chose power. He refused to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, condemning Nosgoth to a slow descent into ruin. This act, while defiant, severed the remaining hope for natural restoration and heralded the age of vampiric rule.
Kain raised an empire and sired six lieutenants, each of whom evolved into powerful clan leaders. Among them was Raziel, who transcended Kain‚Äôs form, earning his master's wrath. Kain cast Raziel into the Abyss, where he was claimed by the Elder God.
Reborn as a wraith, Raziel became a champion of the Spectral Realm. His hunt for Kain transformed into a journey across time and fate, manipulated by ancient forces like Moebius the Time Streamer and the parasitic Elder God, who fed on souls through the Wheel of Fate.
Time unravelled as Kain and Raziel clashed and collided across centuries. Both became pawns and players in a grand metaphysical game involving prophecy, paradox, and the legacy of the Pillars. Neither fully understood the cost of their defiance.
The Pillars themselves were tied to the health of Nosgoth and its people. As each member of the corrupted Circle of Nine was slain, the Pillars briefly flickered toward restoration‚Äîbut the Balance remained broken without a true sacrifice.
As the centuries waned, the Sarafan Order rose again, reborn from the ashes of fallen human kingdoms. No longer simple priests or warriors, they became zealots, using glyph magic and forbidden relics to wage war against vampirekind.
The Hylden, long imprisoned, began to seep back into Nosgoth through planar breaches and possession. Their influence infected mortals and constructs alike, warping regions into machines of war and madness. The Sarafan Lord himself was a Hylden vessel.
With Kain battling to reshape destiny and Raziel learning of his origin as a reforged soul‚Äîonce a Sarafan himself‚ÄîNosgoth spiraled into a war of identity, memory, and metaphysical consequence.
In the end, Raziel embraced sacrifice, merging with the Soul Reaver blade and empowering Kain to glimpse the corruption‚Äôs root. Yet even then, the fate of Nosgoth remained uncertain, its restoration tied to a prophecy never fully spoken.
With the Elder God revealed as a manipulator of souls, and the Wheel of Fate exposed as a parasitic cycle, Kain stood alone with a glimmer of rebellion in his heart and the soul of his former brother within his weapon.
Nosgoth now exists as a shattered reflection of itself. The lands are blighted, the Pillars are ruins, and magic bleeds into reality from spectral fissures. Factions vie for dominance, unaware they are echoes of broken truths.
Yet still, heroes rise. Mortals, vampires, and beings in between seek the lost knowledge, artifacts, and truths buried beneath the wars of gods and kings. Their steps echo across realms, guided by remnants of purpose.
Nosgoth endures‚Äînot as a land of peace, but as a crucible. It is a world forged by choice, rebellion, and the fragile hope that even in the shadow of destiny, free will can ignite something more.
Following Raziel‚Äôs sacrifice, Kain wielded the Soul Reaver not just as a weapon, but as a vessel of knowledge. His understanding of the Elder God's manipulation grew, and so too did his resistance to the predestined spiral of decay.
Yet resistance alone was not enough. Nosgoth‚Äôs lands continued to fracture‚Äîrivers dried into blood-cracked valleys, forests withered to husks, and spectral rifts erupted across the countryside, devouring reality and replacing it with unfiltered memory.
Survivors clung to ruined strongholds and arcane enclaves. City-states formed, ruled by vampire barons, corrupted priests, or rogue glyph-wardens who protected their people from both monsters and metaphysical threats.
The Spectral Realm, once a shadow of the Material, began to bleed into it. Some individuals became attuned to both planes, acting as mediators, spies, or saboteurs for forces seeking to control the riftborn territories.
Hylden war-engines, dormant since the time of the Sarafan Lord, began to stir again. These biomechanical horrors wandered without orders, enslaving those they found and building eldritch spires that reached toward the sky like teeth of forgotten gods.
Meanwhile, remnants of the Circle of Nine attempted to reform‚Äînot as protectors of balance, but as seekers of forbidden knowledge. Their fractured organization became known as the Pale Accord, devoting themselves to unraveling the bindings of fate.
Among them rose mortals touched by ancient echoes‚Äîmarked by glyphs that shimmered with spectral fire. These glyphborn were hunted by all factions, for their very presence hinted at a means to rewrite destiny‚Äôs design.
The Elder God, though weakened, remained active. Its influence now whispered not from beneath the Spectral Realm, but through dreams, madness, and forgotten hymns embedded in stone and blood.
New religions emerged. Some worshiped Kain as a reluctant messiah, others Raziel as a holy martyr. Cults arose around the Wheel of Fate itself, believing its spiral could still be mastered rather than escaped.
The Pillars became pilgrimage sites. Though cracked and decaying, each still pulsed with a fragment of ancient power. Those who reached them untainted sometimes heard voices‚Äîor received visions of possible futures.
In distant corners of Nosgoth, warlocks and soulbinders discovered ancient sarcophagi containing proto-vampires‚Äîbeings born before the Pillars. These ancients bore no allegiance to Kain or the Elder God, and their awakening brought new uncertainties.
Some vampires evolved beyond known bloodlines, developing spectral resonance and spell-like mutations. They abandoned their clans and formed the Crimson Fracture, a rogue sect believing the only way forward was to merge the realms completely.
Feral beasts, warped by ambient magic, roamed across former strongholds. These creatures‚Äîonce wolves, bears, or birds‚Äînow shimmered with half-existence, existing partially in the Spectral Realm and immune to mundane harm.
The Sarafan remnants regrouped in the Hollow Fortress, protected by barriers of forbidden glyphs and soul engines. They declared a crusade against all vampire-blooded, razing settlements and defiling sacred sites.
As Nosgoth‚Äôs moons drifted out of alignment, omens appeared in the sky‚Äîfractures of starless black and comets trailing silver fire. Astrologers, once charlatans, became prophets of ruin and transformation.
Kain, now a spectral wanderer more than a ruler, visited battlefields and tombs. His presence was often unannounced‚Äîa glimpse in a mirror, a shadow over firelight. Many feared him, but some believed he still sought redemption.
The Soul Reaver pulsed with Raziel‚Äôs essence, granting Kain rare glimpses into the Spectral Realm without crossing over. With it, he could sense echoes of events long past and futures yet to be birthed.
Amid all this, rumors began to spread of the Abyssal Heart‚Äîan artifact older than the Pillars themselves, said to contain either the seed of rebirth or the final unmaking of Nosgoth. It became a quest whispered among outcasts, scholars, and seers alike.
Entire regions turned to ash without battle, erased by unknown forces. Survivors claimed they had seen ‚ÄúReflections given form‚Äù‚Äîmirror-selves, acting out forgotten sins and devouring identity.
And still, Nosgoth endures. Broken, bleeding, but never still. Its history is not one of endings, but of cycles‚Äîblood-fed, soul-bound, and ever spinning within the ruins of power and prophecy.
