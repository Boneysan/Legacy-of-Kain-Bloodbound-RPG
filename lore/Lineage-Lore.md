## Vampires

Once stewards of balance, now immortal predators fractured by Kain’s defiance, the vampire broods echo their progenitors’ power and flaws. Their houses grew territorial and bestial as the Pillars fell and time twisted. Every clan is a theology of hunger—part empire, part curse.

Sublineages and notes:
- Razielim: Cast into the Abyss and reborn in spectral flame, winged pariahs believed extinct. Ghost-proud, fate-obsessed, seeking revenge, answers, or heritage.
- Turelim: Warrior-kings with seismic voices. Fortress builders, loyalist conquerors, suspicious of corruption.
- Dumahim: Stoic titans—entombed, patient, relentless. Awaken beneath cathedrals or war engines.
- Zephonim: Parasitic mutations adapted to vertical ruins. Ambushers, secret-keepers, masters of ascent.

Common threads:
- Immortality without legacy; sterile and hunted by time.
- Schisms over Kain’s choice and the meaning of balance.
- Sanctums in towers, catacombs, and blood-wells; rites of dominion.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A conclave calls a Truce of Nights; sabotage or secure the fragile peace.
	- A Razielim relic stirs the Abyss; retrieve it before a clan war erupts.
	- A blood-tax sparks rebellion in a human quarter; broker terms or break chains.
- NPC mentor template: Name (clan epithet) • Role (matriarch/patron) • Quirk (never casts a shadow) • Ask/Price (oath or blood tithe) • Teaches (etiquette, survival politics) • Hooks (renegade brood, cursed vow).

## Wraiths

Souls severed by violent death or unfinished destiny. Many drift to madness; a rare few cling to identity. They phase between realms, drawing strength from memory, emotion, and Soul—half warning, half witness to the Wheel’s appetite.

Common threads:
- Haunted by echoes; empowered by purpose.
- See what mortals miss—planar seams, soul currents, spectral predators.
- Persecuted as omens, courted as guides.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- Lost names whisper from a collapsed mausoleum; carry them to rest.
	- A planar rift feeds on regret; patch it with truth, not stone.
	- A hunted wraith seeks to die properly; grant closure or defy the Wheel.
- NPC mentor template: Name (lament-title) • Role (guide-between) • Quirk (speaks to reflections) • Ask/Price (remember me) • Teaches (safe phasing paths) • Hooks (soul-eater, binding script).

## Humans

Frail yet defiant, humanity endures purges, invasions, and its own zealotry. Adaptive, divided, and unquiet, they swing between faith and survival. Where vampires build dominion, humans build stories—and resistance.

Subgroups and notes:
- Sarafan: Zealous knightly orders—once divine enforcers, now secretive hunters and ward-keepers. Discipline, purity rites, and glyph-lit sanctums.
- Nomads: Refusers of thrones and temples. Roaming reclamationists who map wildlands and barter with ruins.
- Oracle-Blooded: Born under omens, touched by whispers. Seers, healers, truth-speakers—feared and sought in equal measure.

Common threads:
- Barter economies and covenant debts.
- Bitter memory of the vampire ascendancy and Hylden wars.
- Survival through craft, faith, and stubborn kinship.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A Sarafan reliquary goes missing; return it before it becomes a war-banner.
	- A Nomad map shows a moving oasis; it’s a living creature.
	- An Oracle-Blooded predicts your doom—unless you defy three small fates.
- NPC mentor template: Name (trade-name or title) • Role (elder, captain, seer) • Quirk (keeps tally knots) • Ask/Price (service rendered) • Teaches (routes, contacts, rites) • Hooks (faction debt, false prophecy).

## Hylden-Blooded

Mortals reshaped by the banished race’s alien influence—through artifacts, rituals, whispers, or experiments. The corruption marks flesh and mind: glyph scarring, bio-mechanical growths, eyes reflecting the void. Power arrives hand-in-hand with the erosion of self.

Common threads:
- Fragmented directives echoing from the exile plane.
- Mastery of glyphcasting and forbidden arts at a terrible price.
- Feared by humans, distrusted by vampires, coveted by conspirators.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A glyph-iron growth spreads through a ward; amputate the district or cure it.
	- Whispers promise a cure for corruption; it’s a trap set by a Remnant.
	- A Hylden engine needs a conscience; whose soul would you wire in?
- NPC mentor template: Name (sigil-name) • Role (defector scholar) • Quirk (writes on skin) • Ask/Price (artifact shard) • Teaches (risks, counters) • Hooks (exile hunters, living machine).

## Revenants

Corpse-bound souls animated by sheer will or mistake—half-wraith, half-corpse. They rot, yet remember. Their second life is a contract with purpose: vengeance unfed, debts unpaid, vows unfulfilled.

Common threads:
- Unfinished business that bends fate around them.
- Resisted by sanctified ground; tolerated by pragmatists.
- Stories of guardianship, obsession, and tragic clarity.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A revenant guards a bridge until a promise is kept; define the promise.
	- A necromancer sells second chances; collect the bill.
	- A saint’s bones refuse interment; discover who still needs forgiveness.
- NPC mentor template: Name (grave-name) • Role (watchman or oath-keeper) • Quirk (leaves ash prints) • Ask/Price (finish this) • Teaches (oath-binding, remembrance) • Hooks (wronged village, stolen vow).

## Unbound

Anomalies born of temporal misfires and metaphysical ruptures. The Unbound defy prophecy and refuse the Wheel’s grammar. Luck and timing warp around them—glitches in fate that no oracle can chart.

Common threads:
- Immune to easy categorization and control.
- Magnetize accidents, opportunities, and paradoxes.
- Revered as proof of freedom; reviled as insults to order.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A prophecy stalls on your presence; restart or rewrite the world’s line.
	- A time-thief wants to buy your “unused moments.”
	- A paradox child vanishes in places it has not yet been; track a future.
- NPC mentor template: Name (impossible title) • Role (wanderer anomaly) • Quirk (never appears to use doors) • Ask/Price (one coin flipped later) • Teaches (dodging fate) • Hooks (Warden inquiry, Elder attention).
