# World Primer: Nosgoth

*"History abhors a paradox."*

Welcome to Nosgoth—a world where time is a weapon, death is negotiable, and every prophecy is a lie wrapped around a harder truth. This is a realm of gothic stone and eldritch shadow, where vampire lords scheme in candlelit halls, zealot-priests hunt with glyph and flame, and the past reaches forward to strangle the future before it can be born.

Here, the sky is the color of a bruise. Rivers run black with silt and old sins. Ruins outnumber the living, and even the dead do not rest easy. The world was held in balance once, by nine Pillars and nine Guardians—but the Pillars are cracked, the Guardians corrupt or mad, and the great powers that remain feed on the decay like carrion birds circling a dying titan.

You will walk roads where ghosts remember your face, bargain with creatures who measure payment in years and memories, and stand at crossroads where every choice carves a scar across eternity. Fate has a design for you. Prophecy has written your ending. The question is: will you let them?

## Overview of Nosgoth
Nosgoth is a dark, gothic realm steeped in ancient magic, time paradoxes, and a constant struggle between fate and free will. Once kept in balance by the Pillars of Nosgoth, the world is now fractured by corruption, war, and the schemes of powers mortal and cosmic. Vampirism, divine manipulation, betrayal, and cyclical destruction run deep through every story.

The sky here rarely offers more than gray—a perpetual twilight broken only by the green-tinged moon or the sulfurous glow of distant fires. Stone weeps, rivers run black with silt and memory, and entire villages are found abandoned, their doors open, meals cold on tables. The air tastes of iron and rain-to-come. Every ruin hides a whisper; every crossroads bears a warning stone worn smooth by frightened hands.

This is a world where the past refuses to die, where destinies loop back upon themselves, and where even the dead do not rest easy.

## Major Themes
- Fate vs. Free Will: Can destiny be changed, or only delayed?
- Corruption of Power: Power grants purpose—and invites decay.
- Time and Paradoxes: Actions echo across eras; consequences arrive out of order.
- Moral Ambiguity: Few are purely heroes or villains; choices stain or redeem.

## Key Factions

**Sarafan Order:** Zealot humans hunting the undead with glyph magic—once the wrathful arm of the Circle, now a resurrected crusade. They march in white and gold, chanting hymns that burn the air, their armor etched with sigils that glow faintly in darkness. Historically wiped out by Kain, they have returned (through time-magic or fanatical revival) to cleanse Nosgoth. To see a Sarafan inquisitor is to see conviction without mercy: they will torch a village to kill one vampire, and call it salvation.

**Vampire Clans:** Fractured broods under Kain's shadow; proud, territorial, and bound by ancient slights. Each clan bears the mark of their progenitor—some with wings like torn silk, others with claws that carve stone. They gather in crypts and towers, speaking in riddles and veiled insults, their politics a dance of blood debts centuries old. To be sired is to inherit grudges you did not earn.

**Hylden Remnants:** Banished sorcerers of entropy, reaching into Nosgoth from the Demon Realm. Defeated by the Ancients eons ago, they cannot set foot in the material world without a host. They whisper through dimensional cracks—possessing the strong, animating constructs of brass and bone, and scarring the land with green-glowing glyphs. Their goal is simple: to break the binding that holds them, exterminate the Vampires, and reclaim the world they believe was stolen.

**Circle of Nine / Pale Accord:** Broken stewards of the Pillars turned seekers of forbidden knowledge. Once they were guardians; now they are archivists of failure. They hoard scrolls in flooded libraries, perform rituals in the shells of temples, and speak in thesis and counter-thesis. Some seek redemption. Others seek only to leverage the decay for power.

**Elder God / Cult of the Wheel:** A cosmic parasite masking as divinity, preaching the inevitability of the cycle. The Wheel turns: birth, death, consumption, rebirth. The cult's priests wear masks of bone and offer comfort through surrender. Beneath their temples, the Elder God waits—tentacles coiled in the deep, feeding on the souls of all who believe death is rest.

**Outcasts and Guilds:** Mercenaries, scavengers, rogue traders—survivors in the ruins between powers. They deal in coin, relics, secrets, and silence. A guild mark buys you entry to a black market, a smuggler's route, or a blade in the dark. They have no ideology, only pragmatism: the world is ending slowly, so sell what you can and die rich.

## Legendary Figures

**Kain:** Vampire Lord, Scion of Balance; refuses martyrdom and bends time to his will. Clad in blackened armor that drinks light, voice like grinding stone, eyes that have seen empires collapse into themselves. He was offered salvation through suicide and chose damnation through defiance. Every scar he bears is a argument against fate. When Kain speaks, even the Pillars listen—though they no longer obey.

**Raziel:** Wraith martyr, bound within the Soul Reaver; proof and paradox of fate's cruelty. Once Kain's firstborn, now a skeletal revenant with tattered wings and a jaw that cannot close. He was cast into the Abyss for the sin of evolution, drowned and remade as the hunter of his own kin. His voice is wind through a crypt. His hunger devours souls. He is the blade, the martyr, and the key to every lock time has rusted shut.

**Moebius:** Time Streamer, face of order, hand of manipulation. An old man in fine robes, carrying a staff that hums with stolen moments. He smiles when he lies, which is always. Moebius has walked every thread of history, plucking and weaving, ensuring the Wheel turns according to the Elder God's design. He is courtier, kingmaker, and executioner—patient as erosion, cruel as calendar.

**The Elder God:** Ancient hunger feeding on souls through the Wheel of Fate. It calls itself god, architect, shepherd of eternity. In truth it is a parasite older than language, coiled in the roots of the world. Its voice is everywhere—gurgling in flooded halls, whispering in the wind, thrumming beneath the Pillars. It does not hate; it simply feeds. The Wheel is its mouth. All souls are its prey.

**Vorador:** The First of the Turned; ancient vampire lord, master forger, and cynic. Sired by the legendary Janos Audron, Vorador predates the corruption of the Pillars. He wears his decadence like a green velvet coat, managing a harem of brides and a swamp-bound mansion while the world burns. He views Kain's crusade with weary amusement. The humans took his head once—an indignity he has never forgiven.

**Janos Audron:** The Last Ancient; a figure of tragedy and grace. A member of the original winged race that birthed the vampire bloodline. Kept imprisoned for centuries, his heart torn from his chest to power the beating heart of darkness in Avernus. He represents the nobility the vampires lost, a stark contrast to the decay of the modern clans.

## Key Locations

**Pillars of Nosgoth:** World-heart and wound; the axis of balance and corruption. Nine monoliths of white stone, now cracked and weeping black ichor, each one bound to a principle—Mind, Dimension, Conflict, Nature, Energy, Time, States, Death, Balance. They hum discordantly, a broken chord that sets teeth on edge. Stand too close and your thoughts grow strange; dreams bleed into waking. The Pillars were meant to hold the world together. Now they are nails in its coffin.

**The Abyss:** Spectral chasm where Raziel was cast; a scar between realms. A whirlpool of green fire and screaming wind, spiraling down into a throat that has no bottom. The water does not drown—it devours. Those who fall into the Abyss do not die; they are unmade and remade, stripped to will and fury. The air above it tastes of salt and copper. Ghosts avoid it. Even the Elder God does not claim what the Abyss takes.

**Vampire Citadel:** Kain's fortress, nerve center of vampiric dominion. A sprawl of black stone and iron, clinging to cliffs like a crown of thorns. Inside, the halls are vast and cold, lit by green soul-fire, adorned with tapestries depicting slaughters and betrayals. The throne room is a cathedral of bone. From the balconies, one can see the entire western reach of Nosgoth—ruins upon ruins, all the way to the horizon. It is a monument to refusal: Kain would not die, so he built a palace to eternity.

**The Stronghold:** Sarafan bastion; sanctified halls rotting from within. White walls blackened by fire, courtyards choked with graves, chapels where hymns echo wrong. The Sarafan still hold it, but barely—pressed by vampires without, undermined by zealotry within. In its dungeons, they break heretics on wheels. In its archives, they burn histories that contradict their creed. The Stronghold smells of incense and old blood. It is a place where faith has curdled into fear.

**The Spectral Realm:** A parallel, distorted echo; physics lie, memory rules. Everything here is the color of bruises—purples, greens, sickly golds. Gravity is a suggestion. Walls breathe. The dead walk, and some of them remember you. It is a place of truth: you cannot hide what you are when flesh is optional. Linger too long, and the material world begins to feel like the dream.

**Regional sketch (narrative map):**

- **North: Mountains of the Hylden Gate.** Ice-wastes where the wind cuts like broken glass. Tombs carved into glaciers, filled with frozen warriors who do not decay. At the summit, the Gate—a scar in reality, sealed by ancient wards, behind which the Hylden press and whisper. Avalanches here carry voices. The snow remembers footprints from a thousand years ago.

- **East: Ravaged human territories.** The Stronghold looms over blighted rivers that run red with rust and silt. Towns cling to survival, their walls patched with scrap, their wells guarded day and night. Fields grow nothing but thistles. Children are taught to recognize the silhouette of a vampire before they learn their letters. This is where humanity makes its stand—desperate, defiant, and losing.

- **South: Swamps of the Forgotten God.** Drowned temples half-sunk in black water, choked with moss and the hum of alchemical engines still grinding after centuries. The air is thick enough to chew. Fireflies are the only light, and they lead travelers astray. Somewhere in the deep, something sleeps—old, vast, and dreaming of a world that drowned it. The locals leave offerings at the water's edge and do not speak its name.

- **West: The Abyss, the Pillars, and the Citadel.** Canyon country, all sharp edges and sudden drops. The Pillars stand in a blasted heath where nothing grows. Nearby, the Abyss screams. Above it all, the Citadel perches like a raptor, watching, waiting. The wind here carries the scent of ash and ambition. This is the seat of power—vampiric, inevitable, and crumbling only as slowly as stone can bear.

## Timeline of Major Events (abridged)

**The Ancient War:** Hylden vs. Ancients; Hylden are banished. Two civilizations, both arrogant, both powerful, clashed over the soul of the world. The Ancients, winged and sorcerous, worshipped the Wheel and the Elder God. The Hylden rejected divinity and sought to break the cycle of death. The war shattered continents. In the end, the Ancients won—but victory tasted like ash. They bound the Hylden behind a dimensional gate and sealed it with a curse: the Hylden would never know death, never escape, never be free. Exile as eternity.

**Vampiric Curse:** Ancients are cursed, becoming vampires. The Hylden's final spite—a curse woven into the binding. The Ancients, who had championed the Wheel, were cut from it. They would not age, would not die, would hunger for blood and shun the light. Immortality without divinity. The curse twisted them, generation by generation, into something beautiful and monstrous. The winged sorcerers became the first vampires—lords of the night, exiled from their own cycle.

**Corruption of the Pillars:** The Circle of Nine falls; balance falters. The Pillars require guardians—humans born with the mark of a principle, bound to maintain the world's structure. But the dark entity haunting the Circle moved its pawns. Ariel, Guardian of Balance, was murdered. Her lover, **Nupraptor the Mentalist**, went mad with grief, unleashing a psychic wave that poisoned the minds of all the other Guardians with his insanity. One by one, they fell to obsession, madness, and decay. The Pillars cracked. The world began its slow unraveling.

**Kain's Resurrection:** He refuses martyrdom; fate is defied. Kain, a human nobleman, was assassinated and offered a bargain by **Mortanius the Necromancer**—resurrection as a vampire to claim vengeance. He killed his assassins, tore through the corrupt Circle to claim their tokens, and learned the truth: he was the successor to Balance, meant to die to purify the Pillars. He was given a choice: martyr himself to restore the world, or refuse and rule the ashes. Kain chose survival. The Pillars collapsed. Fate screamed, but could not compel him.

**Raziel's Betrayal and Rebirth:** Cast into the Abyss, returns as a wraith. Centuries after Kain's refusal, his empire of vampires ruled. Raziel, firstborn lieutenant, evolved beyond his master—growing wings where Kain had none. Enraged or threatened, Kain tore the wings from Raziel's back and cast him into the Abyss. Raziel drowned, died, and woke as something new: a wraith, empty of soul, burning with purpose. The Elder God whispered to him, naming Kain a betrayer and Raziel a hero. Raziel believed, and became the hunter of his own kind.

**Soul Reaver Prophecy:** Raziel's destiny revealed; cycles unspool. Raziel pursued Kain through time, wielding the Soul Reaver blade—only to discover the weapon was *him*, a future echo bound into steel and prophecy. Every swing was fate trying to close its loop. Every choice was written in stone carved before he existed. The prophecy said Raziel would kill Kain and free the world. But prophecy is a liar, and Raziel began to see the strings.

**Defiance:** Raziel merges with the blade; Kain glimpses a thread of hope. In the final confrontation, Raziel chose to *become* the Soul Reaver, willingly binding his soul into the blade to purify Kain and break the Elder God's design. It was sacrifice, yes—but not the one fate demanded. Kain, now wielding a blade that was once his son, saw what Moebius and the Elder God had hidden: a narrow path, a thread of chance. The Wheel could be broken. The cycle could end. But only if Kain could endure every burden, outlast every betrayal, and refuse hope without surrendering purpose. The war was not over. It had only just begun.

## The Spectral Realm
A plane parallel to material reality where geometry deceives and memory holds weight. Wraiths and spirits wander here, some drawn to emotion, others to the echoes of places. To step into the Spectral is to see the world skinned—all its hidden truths laid bare, all its lies turned to architecture. The living shimmer like mirages. The dead are solid as stone.

**What it feels like:** The air is thick and cold, textured like silk dragged over glass. Colors drain to bruise-tones—purples, greens, sickly golds. You do not walk so much as will yourself forward; the ground is a suggestion. Sounds arrive wrong: whispers loud as bells, screams muted to hums. Your body—if you still have one—feels distant, a coat you are wearing poorly. Hunger, if you feel it at all, is no longer for food.

**Principles:**

- **Distortion:** Time and space warp; paths double back; sound is a rumor. A corridor stretches into infinity or loops back on itself. A doorway leads somewhere it should not—upstairs into a basement, east into yesterday. Clocks run backward. Shadows fall toward the light. The Spectral does not follow rules; it follows *resonance*. Strong emotions carve grooves in reality. Tragedy makes architecture. Walk carefully, or you will find yourself in someone else's memory, wearing their grief like a second skin.

- **Perception:** Spirits and veiled creatures can be seen; mundane matter blurs. The dead are visible here—some aware, some looping their final moments, some wearing faces that shift too fast to read. Creatures hidden in the material realm shed their disguises: demons, wraiths, echoes of gods. Meanwhile, the physical world grows indistinct—walls become fog, flesh becomes gossamer. To the Spectral eye, a locked door is no barrier. But neither is your body.

- **Interaction:** Spectral beings ignore physical armor and pass thin barriers; magic changes character. A steel breastplate offers no protection against a wraith's claws; they reach through iron as if it were mist. Thin walls—wood, cloth, glass—are passable with effort. But magic shifts its nature here: fire burns cold and green, light casts shadows inward, healing draws from the ghost of vitality rather than flesh. Spells fueled by emotion grow stronger. Spells relying on material components grow strange.

- **Consequence:** Staying too long alters the self; some entities hunt those who linger. The Spectral is corrosive to identity. Spend too long, and you forget the weight of your own bones, the taste of bread, the color of sunrise. You begin to *resonate*—your thoughts echo, your presence leaves a stain. Worse, there are predators here: soul-eaters, memory-thieves, and things without names that track the warmth of living thought. The Elder God's tendrils brush close. Time moves wrong. You may return to the material world seconds after you left, or centuries. You may return *different*. Or you may not return at all.

## Using this in play

**Campaign frames:**

- **Balance in Ruins:** The party operates near one of the Pillars—perhaps the Pillar of Nature, where forests grow teeth, or the Pillar of Time, where yesterday and tomorrow swap places without warning. Two factions twist the region in opposite directions: a vampire lord cultivating blood-orchards, a Sarafan chapter burning the land to purify it. The PCs are caught between, asked to choose a side or carve a third path. Each session, the corruption spreads. Each choice reshapes the map. There is no neutrality—only consequences.

- **Blood and Glyph:** A centuries-old war between a vampire brood and a Sarafan chapterhouse has ground to stalemate. Neither side can win, so they recruit proxies, manipulate trade, and settle grudges through intermediaries. The party is hired, seduced, blackmailed, or honor-bound into service. Every favor is a chain. Every debt is a leash. The question is not *if* you will betray someone, but *who*, and *when*, and whether you can live with it after.

- **Spectral Weather:** Soul-storms roll across Nosgoth—localized catastrophes where the Spectral bleeds into the material. During a storm, the dead walk, buildings shift, and time stutters. Afterward, the geography has changed: a new ruin appears, a village is gone, a road leads somewhere it didn't before. The party are *storm-chasers*—explorers, scavengers, or scholars who map the chaos and exploit the opportunities. They race rival crews, dodge spectral predators, and uncover relics pulled from erased timelines. The storms are getting worse. Something is waking.

- **Hylden Signals:** Glyph-static—bursts of magical interference that scramble wards, corrode metal, and drive sensitives mad—are appearing across the region. They point to a buried Hylden device, an engine designed to tear the Gate open from within. The party must locate it, shut it down, or (if they're desperate or ambitious) *reprogram* it. But the Hylden whisper promises through the static, and not everyone in the party may want the engine destroyed. The closer you get, the more the world glitches. Geography loops. Faces flicker. Metal grows like moss. Trust no compass. Trust no memory.

**Quick seeds:**

- **The Calling Lighthouse:** A lighthouse on the cliffs has stood dark for fifty years. Last night, its beacon lit—not with fire, but with a low, resonant hum that pulls at the edges of thought. Spirits drift toward it like moths. Ships run aground. Locals barricade their doors and pray. Someone must climb the tower and silence it. But the keeper is still there, long dead, still tending a light meant to guide something home. Something vast. Something that has finally heard the call.

- **The Name Market:** In a backstreet of a crumbling city, a market operates under no flag and no law. Here, you can buy memories, secrets, and *names*—the true names that grant power over a person. The party hears rumor that someone has sold *their* name. Maybe it was an enemy. Maybe it was a desperate ally. Maybe it was them, in a timeline they don't remember. Now someone out there owns a piece of their identity, and the market's brokers smile when asked for refunds. You want it back? Make an offer. Bring something worth trading. Or take it by force—if you can find the buyer before they use what they bought.

- **The Skipped Day:** A village exists out of phase. Every seventh day, the villagers vanish—not dead, but *elsewhere*. On those days, travelers who enter find a different history: different people, different architecture, different wars. The two timelines are bleeding together. Items left on a skipped day remain. Messages can be passed. But the locals in *both* timelines are starting to notice. And one version of the village wants the other *gone*. The party must choose: stabilize the loop, collapse one timeline, or exploit the fracture before it swallows the region whole.

- **The Ferryman's Price:** A river crossing, deep in hostile territory. The ferry is old, the ferryman older—hooded, silent, patient. He refuses coin. He refuses blood. He wants *a memory you cannot spare*—a moment of joy, a face you love, the day you learned your purpose. Pay it, and you cross safely but diminished. Refuse, and you swim (or drown). The water is black, cold, and full of things with too many teeth. Some in the party will pay. Some will refuse. The river does not care. But the memory the ferryman takes? He *keeps* it. And if you ever meet him again, he will know you better than you know yourself.
