## Overview of Nosgoth
Nosgoth is a dark, gothic realm steeped in ancient magic, time paradoxes, and a constant struggle between fate and free will. Once kept in balance by the Pillars of Nosgoth, the world is now fractured by corruption, war, and the schemes of powers mortal and cosmic. Vampirism, divine manipulation, betrayal, and cyclical destruction run deep through every story.

---

## Major Themes
- Fate vs. Free Will: Can destiny be changed, or only delayed?
- Corruption of Power: Power grants purpose—and invites decay.
- Time and Paradoxes: Actions echo across eras; consequences arrive out of order.
- Moral Ambiguity: Few are purely heroes or villains; choices stain or redeem.

---

## Key Factions
- Sarafan Order: Zealot humans hunting the undead with glyph magic—saints to some, tyrants to others.
- Vampire Clans: Fractured broods under Kain’s shadow; proud, territorial, and bound by ancient slights.
- Hylden Remnants: Banished sorcerers of entropy, reaching into Nosgoth through tech-glyphs and proxies.
- Circle of Nine / Pale Accord: Broken stewards of the Pillars turned seekers of forbidden knowledge.
- Elder God / Cult of the Wheel: A cosmic parasite masking as divinity, preaching the inevitability of the cycle.
- Outcasts and Guilds: Mercenaries, scavengers, rogue traders—survivors in the ruins between powers.

---

## Legendary Figures
- Kain: Vampire Lord, Scion of Balance; refuses martyrdom and bends time to his will.
- Raziel: Wraith martyr, bound within the Soul Reaver; proof and paradox of fate’s cruelty.
- Moebius: Time Streamer, face of order, hand of manipulation.
- The Elder God: Ancient hunger feeding on souls through the Wheel of Fate.
- Vorador: Last of the ancients, blood magus, mentor and monster.

---

## Key Locations
- Pillars of Nosgoth: World-heart and wound; the axis of balance and corruption.
- The Abyss: Spectral chasm where Raziel was cast; a scar between realms.
- Vampire Citadel: Kain’s fortress, nerve center of vampiric dominion.
- The Stronghold: Sarafan bastion; sanctified halls rotting from within.
- The Spectral Realm: A parallel, distorted echo; physics lie, memory rules.

Regional sketch (narrative map):
- North: Mountains of the Hylden Gate—ice-wastes, spirit tombs.
- East: Ravaged human territories—Stronghold, blighted rivers, broken towns.
- South: Swamps of the Forgotten God—ruins, alchemical machines, drowned temples.
- West: The Abyss, shattered Pillars, and the Citadel over canyon scars.

## Timeline of Major Events (abridged)
- The Ancient War: Hylden vs. Ancients; Hylden are banished.
- Vampiric Curse: Ancients are cursed, becoming vampires.

- Kain’s Resurrection: He refuses martyrdom; fate is defied.
- Raziel’s Betrayal and Rebirth: Cast into the Abyss, returns as a wraith.
- Soul Reaver Prophecy: Raziel’s destiny revealed; cycles unspool.
- Defiance: Raziel merges with the blade; Kain glimpses a thread of hope.

---

## The Spectral Realm
A plane parallel to material reality where geometry deceives and memory holds weight. Wraiths and spirits wander here, some drawn to emotion, others to the echoes of places. 

Principles:
- Distortion: Time and space warp; paths double back; sound is a rumor.
- Perception: Spirits and veiled creatures can be seen; mundane matter blurs.
- Interaction: Spectral beings ignore physical armor and pass thin barriers; magic changes character.
- Consequence: Staying too long alters the self; some entities hunt those who linger.

## Using this in play
- Campaign frames:
	- Balance in Ruins: PCs pick a Pillar-adjacent region and wrestle with two powers twisting it in opposite ways.
	- Blood and Glyph: A slow war between a vampire brood and a Sarafan chapterhouse pulls the party between oaths and debts.
	- Spectral Weather: Periodic soul-storms reshape maps and memories; the party charts and exploits the calamity.
	- Hylden Signals: Glyph-static outbreaks point to a buried engine; shut it down or rewire it.
- Quick seeds:
	- A lighthouse that calls spirits instead of ships begins to sing again.
	- A market trades in names; someone sells yours.
	- A village skips every seventh day; on the missing days, another history plays through.
	- A ferryman refuses coin—he wants a memory you can’t spare.
- Patron template (fill-in):
	- Name (sobriquet) • Faction/Role (e.g., archivist of the Pale Accord, Sarafan castellan, clan matriarch) • Quirk (odd tell) • Ask/Price (what they want, what it costs) • Offers (safehouse, relic, map, pardon) • Hooks (rival, secret, ticking clock).
