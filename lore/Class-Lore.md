## Blood Knight

Once temple guardians and arena champions, Blood Knights are forged in battle and raised in blood rites. Their legacy stems from vampiric warlords who survived Kain’s purges and founded martial sects. Bound by honor and violence, they treat combat as sacrament—pain as proof of purpose. Many are former Dumahim who broke ranks to launch new crusades across Nosgoth, channeling rage and resilience into overwhelming might.

Common threads:
- Origins in vampiric war-cults and fortress orders.
- Honor-bound dueling and ritualized violence.
- Seen as tyrants or protectors, depending on the valley’s faction politics.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A Blood Rite arena opens for the first time in decades; the champion’s sigil matches a PC’s forgotten lineage.
	- A war-host marches to “purify” a ruin; the only way to avert massacre is ritual combat by proxy.
	- A rival knight carries a relic blade that drinks vows; breaking it requires an oath freely forsaken.
- NPC mentor template: Name (old honorific) • Role (duelist-priest or fortress captain) • Quirk (never removes gauntlets) • Ask/Price (sworn promise or service) • Teaches (martial conduct, dueling codes) • Hooks (feud, heretical rite, lost squire).

## Soul Reaver

Few dare to wield the echoes of the Reaver blade’s legacy. Born of Raziel’s fragmented memory and the path between realms, Soul Reavers phase through worlds and strike at body and spirit alike. Each is haunted by visions of possible futures—and pasts. Rare and feared, they’re often hunted by both Sarafan and Hylden for what they might become.

Common threads:
- Walkers-between-worlds guided by spectral premonition.
- Strive to reconcile fate’s echo with their own will.
- Pursued by fanatics and conspirators who covet or fear Reaver lineage.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- Echoes show two mutually exclusive futures; the Reaver must choose which ruin stands.
	- Sarafan archivists bait a trap with a false prophecy that only a Reaver can contradict.
	- A soul-storm sweeps the region; only phasing rituals can rescue the trapped.
- NPC mentor template: Name (whispered epithet) • Role (spectral guide or blade-keeper) • Quirk (answers in paradox) • Ask/Price (carry a message across realms) • Teaches (phasing taboos, reading echoes) • Hooks (sealed gate, hunted by Wardens).

## Shadowmancer

Stalkers of the unseen and masters of misdirection, Shadowmancers arise from the remnants of Zephonim assassin cults. They draw power from the darkness between realms, preferring illusion, terror, and sudden violence over open battle. They serve as spies and saboteurs in long-forgotten towers where the veil is thin—making secrecy both weapon and sanctuary.

Common threads:
- Legacies in Zephonim rites and clandestine cells.
- Supernatural stealth; warfare through fear and confusion.
- Trusted by few, indispensable to those who understand shadows.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A tower’s shadow moves against the stars—someone is weaving a city-sized veil.
	- A client hires the party to stage a haunting that becomes all too real.
	- A stolen mask lets a petty noble command darkness; retrieve or replace it with a safer decoy.
- NPC mentor template: Name (many aliases) • Role (spymaster or veilmage) • Quirk (never stands in direct light) • Ask/Price (one secret for another) • Teaches (misdirection crafts) • Hooks (rival cell, cursed disguise).

## Sangromancer

Heirs to Nosgoth’s darkest magical legacy, Sangromancers practice blood sorcery. They blend Hylden rites, vampiric biology, and forbidden alchemy to reshape flesh and seize the battlefield. Banned by the Sarafan and feared by the Balance Wardens, many hide in ruined temples and blood-wells, their power rising with every drop spilled—and with an intimate sense of the living pulse of the world.

Common threads:
- Taboos broken in pursuit of living magic.
- Hermetic circles in catacombs, cisterns, and old sanctums.
- Feared healers and feared killers—two edges of the same blade.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A blood-well awakens; the circle that tended it has vanished.
	- A plague is actually a binding ritual miscast; cure requires a willing sacrifice.
	- A Hylden reliquary offers power for a city’s heartbeat—literally.
- NPC mentor template: Name (arterial title) • Role (chirurgeon-magus) • Quirk (counts heartbeats aloud) • Ask/Price (sample or vow) • Teaches (taboo ethics, safe rites) • Hooks (runaway apprentice, vengeful patient).

## Glyph Seeker

Glyph Seekers are sigil-scribes and arcane geometers who channel structured magic through symbols, relics, and spatial law. Their lineage predates the Pillars’ fall. They aim to restore order by precise enchantment. Many are exiled Hylden researchers or humans trained in mountain vault academies. Their wards and circuits keep what’s left of the world from collapsing into chaos.

Common threads:
- Ritual engineers of wards, locks, and latticed energies.
- Quiet alliances with archivists, wardens, and city stewards.
- Measured faith that rules—properly drawn—can still hold.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A city ward collapses every dusk; trace the missing sigil in the catacombs.
	- A moving caravan is actually a distributed glyph; steal one wagon and the spell unravels.
	- An Archglyph sentinel has gone feral; rebind or retire it without destroying the archive.
- NPC mentor template: Name (scribe-mark) • Role (ward architect) • Quirk (speaks in geometries) • Ask/Price (recover a broken rune) • Teaches (counter-glyphs, safe dismantling) • Hooks (political sabotage, forbidden lattice).

## Dreadblade

Assassins shaped into weapons, Dreadblades descend from Sarafan enforcers or cursed Zephonim war-survivors. They blend magic with martial precision, favoring single-strike kills and spectral poisons. Often solitary or deployed as elite scouts into cursed territories, their footfalls are auguries: every blade an execution, every step a death foretold.

Common threads:
- Lineages in inquisitions, black ops, and war remnants.
- Executioner’s pragmatism—strike once, vanish utterly.
- Unsettling mix of discipline, fatalism, and ritual purity.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A contract targets a “monster” who is actually a key witness; swap death for disappearance.
	- Spectral venom supplies are tainted; find the source before blades turn on their wielders.
	- A cult trades names for protection; sever the ledger without starting a war.
- NPC mentor template: Name (silent title) • Role (handler or knife-monk) • Quirk (collects last words) • Ask/Price (one truth as collateral) • Teaches (extraction, clean exits) • Hooks (burned cover, moral line).

## Warden of Balance

Sworn to the shattered Pillars, Wardens are chosen by visions or remade through divine ritual. They are part priest, part enforcer, and part oracle, seeking equilibrium between realm, magic, and morality. Some are lapsed Sarafan or Oracle-Blooded granted insight. Duty—not power—fuels their gifts, and judgment is their burden.

Common threads:
- Oaths to weigh ends against means.
- Pilgrimages between sites where the veils fray.
- Ally and adversary alike test their definitions of “balance.”

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A Judgment Wheel law is abused to oppress a district; rewrite it in ceremony.
	- Two miracles claim the Pillars’ blessing—only one is real, and both have followers.
	- A time-stasis reliquary fails, releasing a century-old grievance.
- NPC mentor template: Name (title of office) • Role (arbiter-priest) • Quirk (never turns their back on anyone) • Ask/Price (mediate a feud) • Teaches (oathcraft, lawful rites) • Hooks (schismatic Warden, corrupted edict).

## Hylden Warlock

Exiles, traitors, and entropy-scarred prophets, Hylden Warlocks draw on glyph decay, soul leeching, and forbidden prophecy. Many fled the Spectral Realm bearing fragments of the Wheel itself. They twist time’s threads and sanity’s seams. To them, power is proof—god and gospel in one.

Common threads:
- Apostate scholars with void-marked minds.
- Entropic rites, grim bargains, and weaponized despair.
- Pursued by Wardens; courted by factions that prefer ends to means.

### Using this in play
- Quest seeds:
	- A Decay Field is eating a neighborhood’s memories; map and anchor them before they fade.
	- A doom-prophecy spreads like a plague of words; break its cadence or break its author.
	- A banished entity answers questions—for a price measured in sanity.
- NPC mentor template: Name (void sobriquet) • Role (exile-prophet) • Quirk (blinks out mid-sentence) • Ask/Price (carry a shard, accept a scar) • Teaches (safe channels, lines not to cross) • Hooks (Hylden conclave, price of knowledge).
