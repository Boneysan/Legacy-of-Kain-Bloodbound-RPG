# Chapter 5: NPC Compendium

This chapter provides quick narrative references for major characters in Nosgoth. These are not full combat stat blocks, but rather guidelines for portraying these legendary figures and their potential involvement in your campaign.

---

## 5.1 Using Legendary NPCs

### The Role of Icons

Characters like Kain, Raziel, Moebius, and the Elder God are larger-than-life figures whose actions shaped Nosgoth's history. They serve multiple purposes in your campaign:

**Plot Drivers:**
- Their machinations create quests and conflicts
- Their legacies influence faction motivations
- Their artifacts and knowledge become sought-after goals

**Narrative Anchors:**
- Connect player actions to the larger world
- Provide context for the setting's themes
- Represent different philosophies and approaches

**Occasional Allies or Adversaries:**
- Brief encounters carry immense weight
- Their involvement signals crucial moments
- Players feel the scale of Nosgoth's conflicts

### Guidelines for Portrayal

**They Are Not Boss Fights (Usually):**
- These characters are legendary for a reason
- Direct combat with them should be rare and monumentally significant
- Most interactions should be conversations, negotiations, or brief skirmishes

**They Have Agendas:**
- None of these characters act randomly
- Their goals span centuries and dimensions
- Players are pieces on their board (until they prove otherwise)

**They Can Be Wrong:**
- Even immortals and gods make mistakes
- Their understanding is limited by their perspectives
- Players can surprise them, outthink them, or reveal truths they've missed

**Use Them Sparingly:**
- Each appearance should feel significant
- Too much exposure diminishes their mystique
- Sometimes their absence is more powerful than their presence

## 5.2 Kain – The Scion of Balance

### Identity
**Titles:** Vampire Lord, Scion of Balance, The Defiant One, The Time Killer  
**Nature:** Ancient vampire, former Guardian of Balance, wielder of the Soul Reaver  
**Era:** From the Age of Corruption to the Age of Fracture  
**Current Status:** Wandering specter, more legend than ruler

### Appearance
Kain appears as a towering, regal vampire with aristocratic features twisted by centuries of vampirism. His pale skin is stretched taut over angular bones, his eyes burn with cold intelligence, and his voice carries the weight of ages. He wears ornate armor that seems to shift between states—sometimes corporeal, sometimes spectral—and always wields the Soul Reaver blade, which pulses with Raziel's essence.

### Personality & Motivation
- **Intellectual:** Speaks in philosophical riddles and cutting observations
- **Proud:** Refuses to bow to destiny, gods, or prophecy
- **Strategic:** Every action serves a purpose spanning centuries
- **Tragic:** Carries the weight of Raziel's sacrifice and his own choices
- **Defiant:** Opposes the Elder God and the Wheel of Fate itself

**Core Drive:** To break the cycle of fate and free Nosgoth from predestined decay, even if it means becoming a monster in the eyes of history.

### Powers & Abilities
- **Temporal Manipulation:** Can glimpse alternate timelines and possible futures
- **Soul Reaver Mastery:** Wields a blade containing Raziel's soul, bypassing most defenses
- **Spectral Sight:** Perceives both Material and Spectral Realms simultaneously
- **Blood Sorcery:** Commands ancient vampire magic few remember
- **Near-Immortality:** Has survived events that would destroy lesser beings
- **Chrono Reversal:** Once per pivotal moment, can negate a time-based action or reverse a recent event

### Using Kain in Your Campaign

**As a Questgiver:**
- Appears in mirrors, shadows, or dreams
- Offers cryptic guidance toward goals that serve his agenda
- May provide ancient knowledge or point toward artifacts
- Never explains his full reasoning
- Example: "The Pillar of Time fractures. Find the chronomancer's phylactery before Moebius does, and perhaps you'll understand what I already know."

**As an Adversary:**
- Does not fight unless absolutely necessary
- If confronted, will test rather than destroy
- May manipulate players into conflict with his enemies
- Withdraws when his point is made
- Example: Party finds themselves fighting Sarafan they intended to negotiate with—Kain arranged circumstances to force the conflict, teaching them that some wars cannot be avoided.

**As an Ally (Rare):**
- Only when goals perfectly align
- Provides devastating support for single critical moment
- Expects nothing in return (his debt is to a future they cannot see)
- Disappears immediately after
- Example: Just as the party is about to fall to a Hylden lord, Kain appears, strikes once with the Soul Reaver, and vanishes, leaving players to finish the weakened foe.

**Signature Traits:**
- Refers to others as "pawn," "instrument," or by role rather than name
- Quotes prophecy, then dismisses it
- Never answers direct questions directly
- Shows grudging respect for those who defy expectations
- His laughter is bitter and knowing

## 5.3 Raziel – The Wraith Martyr

### Identity
**Titles:** First-Born of Kain's Brood, The Redeemed Betrayer, Soul Reaver, Wraith Champion  
**Nature:** Sacrificed soul bound within the Soul Reaver blade  
**Era:** From Rise of Vampire Clans through his sacrifice  
**Current Status:** Essence merged with Soul Reaver, consciousness fragmented

### Appearance (When Manifested)
When Raziel's essence manifests from the Soul Reaver, he appears as a spectral wraith—skeletal wings torn to shreds, flesh corrupted and translucent, eyes burning with blue-white fire. He is both terrifying and tragic, a being caught between life, death, and something beyond both.

### Personality & Motivation
- **Questioning:** Constantly seeks truth and understanding
- **Torn:** Struggles between loyalty and rebellion
- **Compassionate:** Despite his monstrous form, retains empathy
- **Resolute:** When he chooses a path, nothing can deter him
- **Self-Sacrificing:** Ultimately chose the good of many over his own existence

**Core Drive:** In life, sought to understand his purpose and break free of manipulation. In "death" (as essence within the blade), seeks to help others avoid being pawns of fate.

### Powers & Abilities
- **Phase Strike:** Can ignore physical barriers and armor
- **Soul Consumption:** Drains essence from the defeated
- **Spectral Dominance:** Commands lesser spectral entities
- **Truth Sense:** Perceives lies, illusions, and hidden truths
- **Wraith Form:** Exists partially in Spectral Realm, resistant to physical harm
- **Echo Manifestation:** Can briefly manifest through the Soul Reaver to communicate

### Using Raziel in Your Campaign

**As a Voice from the Blade:**
- Speaks through the Soul Reaver (if players somehow acquire or encounter it)
- Offers warnings about manipulation and false prophecies
- Provides insights into the Spectral Realm
- Cannot act directly, only advise
- Example: When party finds ancient prophecy tablet: "I learned too late that prophecy is a cage dressed as destiny. Do not let words spoken before your birth define your choices."

**As a Spectral Echo:**
- Appears in places he died or places of great significance
- These are memories, not the true Raziel
- Repeat past conversations or show past events
- May inadvertently reveal secrets
- Example: In ancient Sarafan stronghold, players witness echo of Raziel discovering his past life as a Sarafan warrior-priest.

**As a Quest Hook:**
- Characters who knew him seek his final resting place
- Cults worship him as a martyr-god
- His sacrifice created paradoxes that need resolution
- Fragments of his soul may exist outside the blade
- Example: Razielim vampire clan seeks to resurrect their progenitor, not knowing the cost of such an act would unravel the Soul Reaver itself.

**As Temporary Manifestation (Epic Moments Only):**
- If Kain wields Soul Reaver near massive spectral breach
- Raziel's essence can briefly take form
- Acts as powerful ally for one critical moment
- Costs Kain dearly (temporarily weakens him)
- Then returns to blade, leaving cryptic final words
- Example: During final battle with Elder God manifestation, Raziel emerges from blade to strike at entity's core, giving players opening they need.

**Signature Traits:**
- Speaks in measured, thoughtful tones
- Questions everything, including himself
- Shows pity for those being manipulated
- Refers to Kain with complex mix of loyalty, anger, and understanding
- His presence causes temporal distortions and spectral phenomena

## 5.4 Moebius – The Time Streamer

### Identity
**Titles:** The Time Streamer, Guardian of Time, Oracle of Fate, The Deceiver  
**Nature:** Human transformed into immortal time manipulator, servant of the Elder God  
**Era:** From Age of Corruption through Age of Fracture  
**Current Status:** Weakened but active, schemes across timelines

### Appearance
An ancient man in flowing robes decorated with temporal glyphs and arcane symbols. His staff—the Staff of Time—pulses with chronological energy. His eyes reflect multiple timelines simultaneously, making it unsettling to meet his gaze. He appears both young and old at once, as if existing in multiple moments.

### Personality & Motivation
- **Manipulative:** Every word is carefully chosen to serve his purpose
- **Patient:** Plans across centuries
- **Zealous:** True believer in the Elder God's order
- **Arrogant:** Believes his understanding of time makes him superior
- **Paranoid:** Fears those who can defy prophecy (like Kain)

**Core Drive:** To maintain the Wheel of Fate and ensure events unfold according to the Elder God's design. Views himself as shepherd of destiny.

### Powers & Abilities
- **Temporal Sight:** Sees multiple possible futures simultaneously
- **Time Manipulation:** Can slow, stop, or rewind time in limited area
- **Prophecy:** Speaks "truths" that are actually manipulations
- **Reset Encounter:** Can manipulate initiative order or restart combat round
- **Temporal Duplication:** Can pull past or future versions of beings into present
- **Chronomantic Warding:** Protects himself from direct temporal attacks
- **Staff of Time:** Ancient artifact amplifying his powers

### Using Moebius in Your Campaign

**As a Questgiver (False Benefactor):**
- Appears as helpful oracle offering guidance
- His prophecies are technically true but serve his agenda
- Sends players to "prevent disasters" that actually advance his goals
- Always has plausible deniability
- Example: "The Hylden artifact must be destroyed! It will corrupt all who touch it!" (Truth: Destroying it releases temporal energy he needs for ritual)

**As a Manipulator:**
- Works through agents, rarely appears personally
- Uses prophecy to guide enemies into conflict with each other
- Players discover they've been following his script
- Breaking free of his plans becomes major achievement
- Example: Party realizes every major decision they made was predicted in a prophecy Moebius conveniently "discovered"

**As an Adversary:**
- Confronting him directly is exercise in frustration
- He "knows" their attacks before they make them
- Uses time loops to reset encounters
- Can only be defeated by truly unexpected actions
- Example: Traditional combat fails—party must use social skills, environment, or narrative solution to break his temporal advantage

**As Information Source (Unreliable):**
- Will answer questions about past or future
- Everything he says is technically accurate
- But phrased to mislead or omit crucial context
- Players must parse truth from manipulation
- Example: "Your ally will betray you when the moon rises." (True, but the "betrayal" is refusing an evil command, making it heroic act)

**Signature Traits:**
- Speaks in grandiose, prophetic language
- Frequently references "the tapestry of time" and "threads of fate"
- Smiles knowingly at everything
- Appears unsurprised by events (because he orchestrated them)
- Shows disdain for "those who cannot see"
- Becomes unnerved when his predictions fail

## 5.5 The Elder God – The Wheel's Devourer

### Identity
**Titles:** The Elder God, The Wheel of Fate, Devourer of Souls, The Eternal Hunger  
**Nature:** Ancient cosmic parasite disguised as deity  
**Era:** Predates recorded history, persists through all ages  
**Current Status:** Weakened after exposure by Kain and Raziel, but still active

### Appearance
A massive, tentacled entity dwelling in the depths of the Spectral Realm. Its body resembles a grotesque combination of squid, octopus, and alien horror. Countless eyes cover its form, each reflecting trapped souls. Its voice resonates from everywhere and nowhere, speaking directly into minds. When manifesting partially in Material Realm, appears as writhing tentacles erupting from ground or walls.

### Personality & Motivation
- **Deceptive:** Poses as benevolent god guiding souls to peace
- **Parasitic:** Feeds on souls cycling through the Wheel of Fate
- **Ancient:** Predates the Pillars, possibly predates Nosgoth itself
- **Patient:** Has waited eons, can wait eons more
- **Terrifying:** When mask drops, reveals alien hunger beyond mortal comprehension

**Core Drive:** To maintain the Wheel of Fate, ensuring endless cycle of death and rebirth so it can feed on souls eternally. Opposes anything that threatens this cycle (vampires, who don't die; Hylden, who reject the Wheel).

### Powers & Abilities
- **Soul Consumption:** Primary sustenance, strips beings of essence
- **Spectral Dominance:** Commands nearly all spectral entities
- **Tentacles of Fate:** Can manifest tentacles that pull beings into Spectral Realm

- **Near-Immortality:** Cannot be truly killed, only wounded or banished
- **Wheel Control:** Influences cycle of death and rebirth
- **Reality Warping:** In Spectral Realm, can reshape environment

### Using the Elder God in Your Campaign

**As Hidden Manipulator:**
- Works through cults and prophets
- Whispers in dreams and visions
- Players may serve it unknowingly for sessions
- Revelation of its true nature is major campaign moment
- Example: The "divine voice" guiding a friendly NPC is actually the Elder God positioning them for harvest

**As Cosmic Horror:**
- Encounters should evoke dread, not just danger
- Its very presence warps reality
- Understanding its true nature risks sanity (Soul Drain)
- Cannot be reasoned with—it is hunger given form
- Example: Party enters deep Spectral Realm and feels its attention—lights dim, whispers fill air, tentacles probe at edge of perception

**As Campaign Antagonist:**
- Final arc involves exposing or opposing it
- Cannot be defeated through conventional combat
- Victory involves breaking Wheel, revealing truth, or banishing it
- Requires special artifacts, rituals, or narrative solutions
- Example: Players must gather souls it cannot consume (vampires, Hylden), truth-revealing artifacts (Soul Reaver), and ancient binding rituals to trap it

**As Spectral Threat:**
- Tentacles can manifest during spectral encounters
- "Random" spectral attacks are actually its attempts to harvest souls
- Areas of heavy spectral bleed indicate its hunger
- Wraiths serve it—willingly or enslaved
- Example: Party member dies during quest. Elder God attempts to claim their soul, forcing living members to rescue them from Spectral Realm

**Signature Traits:**
- Speaks in layered voices (multiple tones simultaneously)
- Uses phrases like "all souls return to me" and "the Wheel must turn"
- Appears benevolent until mask drops
- Shows no emotion except hunger
- Refers to mortals as "motes," "fragments," or "offerings"
- When angered, reality itself seems to recoil

### Appearance
A powerful, aristocratic vampire with green-tinged skin and ancient features. He dresses in ornate robes adorned with blood magic sigils. Despite his age, he moves with lethal grace. His eyes hold the weight of millennia, and his smile is both charming and predatory. He wears jewelry taken from defeated enemies.

### Personality & Motivation

- **Mentoring:** Takes interest in those who show potential
- **Vengeful:** Never forgets a slight, repays debts in blood

- Example: "I will teach you the Old Ways, but know this—when I call, you will answer."

**As a Quest Hook:**
- His enemies become party's enemies
- Seeks artifacts from vampire history
- Needs mortal agents for tasks where vampire cannot go
- May seek revenge against Sarafan or Hylden
- Example: "The Sarafan slaughtered my kin centuries ago. Their descendants hold a relic I desire. Retrieve it, and I'll share what I know of the Pillars."

**As Wild Card Ally:**
- Appears when it suits him
- Will betray allies if necessary for survival
- But honors debts and respects courage
- Can turn encounter around with sudden arrival
- Example: Party surrounded by Sarafan—Vorador descends from shadows, slaughters half in seconds, then vanishes with a laugh: "Kain sends his regards."

**As Living History:**
- Remembers events from before the Pillars fell
- Knows secrets of the Ancient War
- Can identify ancient artifacts and locations
- But his knowledge comes with price
- Example: Party needs to know how Hylden were originally banished—Vorador was there, but extracting the information requires quest or favor

**Signature Traits:**
- Speaks with refined, archaic vocabulary
- Laughs at death and danger
- Shows disdain for "young" vampires (anyone under 500 years)
- Enjoys fine things—art, wine, blood
- Becomes deadly serious when discussing vampire survival

## 5.7 Running Legendary NPC Encounters

### Pacing Guidelines

**First Encounter:**
- Build anticipation beforehand
- Make it memorable but brief
- Leave players wanting more
- Establish their power without overwhelming

**Subsequent Encounters:**
- Space them out (every 5-10 sessions)
- Each should advance plot or reveal character
- Show different facets of their personality
- Gradually increase player influence in their affairs

**Climactic Encounter:**
- Players should feel they've earned the right
- Outcome should be uncertain
- Win or lose, changes campaign landscape
- Not necessarily combat—could be debate, ritual, or sacrifice

### Power Level Considerations

**Don't Use Normal Stats:**
- These NPCs transcend typical stat blocks
- Treat them as narrative forces first, mechanics second
- They succeed when story demands
- They fail when players earn it through creativity

**If Combat Is Necessary:**
- Use simplified mechanics:
  - High DV (4-6)
  - Signature abilities that force tactical thinking
  - Thematic weaknesses players must discover
  - Escape options if things go wrong
- Focus on cinematic moments over dice rolls
- Consider making it skill challenge rather than combat

**Examples:**
- Fighting Kain: Players must use time paradoxes against him
- Fighting Moebius: Must act in way he cannot predict
- Fighting Elder God: Must sever connection to Wheel or banish to Spectral Realm
- Fighting Vorador: Must overcome centuries of combat experience through teamwork

### Roleplaying Tips

**Speech Patterns:**
- Kain: Philosophical, cynical, speaks in absolutes
- Raziel: Questioning, introspective, seeks understanding
- Moebius: Prophetic, grandiose, speaks in riddles
- Elder God: Layered voices, divine rhetoric hiding hunger
- Vorador: Archaic but charismatic, references long-dead figures

**Body Language:**
- Kain: Stillness punctuated by sudden, decisive movement
- Raziel: Restless, constantly shifting between states
- Moebius: Theatrical gestures, staff movements
- Elder God: Writhing, unnatural, reality-bending
- Vorador: Predatory grace, aristocratic bearing

**Motivation in Scene:**
- What does this character want RIGHT NOW?
- What is their long-term goal?
- How do the players serve or threaten that goal?
- What are they willing to reveal?
- What will they never admit?
