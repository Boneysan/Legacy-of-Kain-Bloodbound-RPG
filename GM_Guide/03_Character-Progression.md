# Chapter 3: Character Progression

This chapter covers how characters advance, gain milestones, and grow in power throughout a campaign.

## 3.1 Milestone Experience System

*Legacy of Kain: Bloodbound RPG* uses milestone-based advancement rather than tracking individual XP. Characters level up when they achieve significant narrative goals.

### What is Milestone Progression?

Characters gain a level when the GM determines they have:
- Completed a major quest or story arc
- Overcome a formidable story-related obstacle
- Made a discovery that profoundly impacts their journey
- Reached a dramatically appropriate point in the narrative

### Advantages of Milestone Progression

**Narrative Focus**
- Emphasizes story goals over combat grinding
- Rewards roleplay, investigation, and creative solutions
- Characters level at dramatically appropriate moments

**Controlled Pacing**
- GM ensures party is appropriately leveled for upcoming challenges
- Prevents over-leveling or under-leveling
- Maintains consistent challenge throughout campaign

**Simplified Tracking**
- No XP calculations or tallying
- Reduced bookkeeping for GM and players
- Group levels together, maintaining cohesion

**Rewards All Playstyles**
- Combat-focused characters benefit equally with social/utility characters
- Exploration and investigation rewarded as much as fighting
- Encourages diverse approaches to challenges

## 3.4 Communicating Milestones

### When to Announce

**End of Session (Preferred):**
- After achieving milestone
- Creates satisfying conclusion
- "After successfully navigating the Sunken Tombs and escaping the Elder God's grasp, you all feel profoundly changed. You've reached Level 6."

**Beginning of Next Session:**
- If milestone achieved late in session
- Allows time for reflection
- "Last session's events have changed you. You may level up to 6."

### How to Announce

**Tie to Narrative:**
Good: "After defeating the vampire lord and witnessing the Pillar's restoration begin, you feel your understanding of Nosgoth's magic deepen. You've reached Level 7."

Poor: "That's enough XP, you level up."

**Highlight Specific Achievements:**
"Your discovery of the Hylden's true purpose, combined with your alliance with the Oracle-Blooded, marks a turning point. Level 10."

**Make It Meaningful:**
- Reference specific player actions
- Connect to character development
- Foreshadow future challenges

## 3.5 Level-Up Process

### During Session vs. Between Sessions

**During Session:**
- **Pros:** Immediate gratification, can use new abilities
- **Cons:** Takes table time, disrupts flow
- **Best For:** Simple levels (early game), short sessions

**Between Sessions:**
- **Pros:** Doesn't interrupt play, players have time to consider choices
- **Cons:** Delayed gratification
- **Best For:** Complex levels (high tier), milestone achieved late in session

### Level-Up Mechanics Reminder

**What Changes at Each Level:**

1. **Hit Points:** Gain HP based on class (4-6 per level)

2. **Class Perk:** Gain your class's level-specific perk
   - Example: Level 6 Blood Knight gains "Juggernaut"

3. **Universal Perks:** Gain at specific levels
   - **Levels 1, 3, 5:** Tier 1 Universal Perk
   - **Levels 6, 8, 10:** Tier 2 Universal Perk
   - **Levels 11, 13, 15:** Tier 3 Universal Perk
   - **Levels 16, 18, 20:** Tier 4 Universal Perk
   - Humans gain additional Universal Perk at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20

4. **Attribute Increases:** At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20
   - Increase one attribute by 1 (max 5)

5. **Resource Pools:** Recalculate based on new level
   - Soul Energy: 3 + Will + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)
   - Blood Points: 4 + Shadow + (Level ÷ 2, rounded up)

6. **Skill Points:** Gain +1 skill point at each level
   - Skill max rank = 5
   - Can increase existing skill or learn new one

---

## 3.6 Alternative Progression Methods

### Partial Milestones

For longer campaigns, consider "half milestones":
- **Minor Milestone:** Gain +2 HP, +1 skill point, no level increase
- Award between major milestones for smaller achievements
- Maintains sense of progress without full level-up
- Example: "You've gained valuable experience. Add +2 HP and +1 skill point."

### Variable Progression

Different characters level at different rates:
- **When to Use:** PC missed several sessions
- **How:** That PC gains milestone when they achieve personal goal
- **Risk:** Party level disparity can create balance issues
- **Mitigation:** Keep gap to 1-2 levels maximum

### Corruption-Based Progression

Tie advancement to Corruption for thematic campaign:
- Reaching Corruption threshold grants bonus perk (beyond normal progression)
- Creates temptation to embrace corruption
- Risk: May make Corruption too attractive
- **Example:** "At Corruption Level 6, you've unlocked insights into forbidden power. Gain one additional Tier 2 Corrupted Perk."

## 3.7 Handling Different Player Attendance

### The Absent Player

**When Player Misses Session with Milestone:**

**Option 1: Level Everyone**
- Absent PC levels with group
- Simple, keeps party together
- Justification: "Your character was training off-screen"

**Option 2: Delayed Milestone**
- Absent PC levels when player returns
- More realistic, creates level gap
- Risk: Player feels behind

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 unless player prefers delayed progression

### The Returning Player

**Player Rejoins After Missing Multiple Milestones:**

**Option 1: Catch Up**
- Level PC to match party
- Prevents imbalance
- Justification: "You've had your own adventures"

**Option 2: Accelerated Progression**
- PC gets milestone after 1-2 sessions
- Catches up gradually over several sessions

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 if absent for extended time (4+ sessions)

## 3.10 Adjudicating Narrative Abilities

### High-Level Reality-Bending Perks

As characters reach higher levels (15+), they may gain perks that allow them to bend or break reality itself. These abilities require careful GM adjudication to maintain narrative integrity while honoring the player's achievement.

### Reality Fracture and Similar Perks

**What It Does:**
Allows a player to narrate an "impossible act"—briefly defying the laws of reality to achieve something extraordinary.

**GM Adjudication Process:**

**Step 1: Listen to Player Intent**
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What's the desired outcome?
- How do they envision it happening?
- What problem are they trying to solve?

**Step 2: Assess Narrative Impact**

Ask yourself:
- **Is it campaign-breaking?** Would it permanently remove all stakes or conflict?
- **Does it negate entire plot arcs?** Would it trivialize major storylines?
- **Is it a creative solution to current obstacle?** This is usually acceptable.
- **Does it create interesting complications?** Best outcomes often do.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ **Allow:** "I fracture reality to teleport us past the Elder God's barrier."
- ✅ **Allow:** "I rewind time 30 seconds to prevent my ally's death."
- ✅ **Allow:** "I create a temporary pocket dimension to hide the artifact."
- ⚠️ **Negotiate:** "I erase Kain from history." (Too broad, but could affect a specific moment)
- ❌ **Deny:** "I restore all Pillars instantly." (Negates entire campaign)
- ❌ **Deny:** "I kill the Elder God permanently." (Removes major antagonist without arc)

**Step 3: Collaborate on Outcome**

The perk specifies the GM resolves it "creatively." This means:
- **Don't Just Say No:** Find a way to make it work if at all possible
- **Negotiate the Details:** "You can teleport past the barrier, but..."
- **Split the Difference:** They achieve something significant, but not exactly as described
- **Maintain Player Agency:** Their decision should matter

**Example Collaboration:**
- **Player:** "I use Reality Fracture to make Moebius forget the prophecy."
- **GM:** "You can't erase knowledge from his mind entirely—he's too powerful. But you can fracture the moment he learned it, causing him to misremember a crucial detail. He now believes the prophecy points to a different location. This buys you time but creates future complications when he realizes the truth."

**Step 4: Introduce Consequence (Optional)**

Even successful reality-bending can have costs:

**Immediate Consequences:**
- Corruption gain (even for non-Corruption perks)
- Physical exhaustion or HP loss
- Temporary disorientation or vulnerability
- Conspicuous magical signature

**Delayed Consequences:**
- Attracts unwanted attention:
  - Elder God becomes aware of them
  - Time Streamers investigate the anomaly
  - Hylden sense the dimensional weakness
  - Paradox demons manifest
- Localized temporal instability:
  - Area becomes unpredictable
  - Time loops or echoes appear
  - Wraiths drawn to the fracture
- Reality "pushes back":
  - Future use of reality-bending is harder
  - Universe tries to "correct" the change
  - Unintended side effects manifest

**Example Consequence:**
"You successfully rewind time to save your ally. As reality snaps back into place, you feel something vast and ancient turn its attention toward you. The Elder God whispers in your mind: 'I see you, little paradox. You have made yourself interesting.' Gain 1 Corruption as the strain of defying causality takes its toll."

### Other High-Level Narrative Abilities

**Time Manipulation Perks:**
- Can create paradoxes if not careful
- Should have limitations (range, duration, uses)
- Best used for dramatic moments, not constant rewinding

**Fate Alteration Perks:**
- Should allow players to change outcomes
- But not remove consequences entirely
- Consider "butterfly effect" complications

**Dimensional/Planar Perks:**
- Opening portals has risks
- Things can come through uninvited
- Spectral and Material Realms might bleed together

**Mind Control/Influence Perks:**
- Strong beings should resist or require sustained effort
- Controlled beings might break free at crucial moments
- Creates moral complications worth exploring

### GM Principles for Powerful Abilities

**Say Yes, But...**
- Find ways to make player ideas work
- Add interesting complications
- Maintain narrative tension

**Respect Player Investment**
- They earned these abilities
- Let them feel powerful
- But not omnipotent

**Maintain Stakes**
- Power should create new problems
- Great threats require great solutions
- Complications keep things interesting

**Use Consequences as Plot Hooks**
- Reality fracture attracts Hylden attention → new arc
- Time manipulation creates paradox → investigation needed
- Dimensional portal left open → something escapes
