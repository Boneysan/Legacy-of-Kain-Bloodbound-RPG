## 1.1 Setting Difficulty Ratings (DR)

The Difficulty Rating system is your primary tool for balancing challenges. Understanding when to use each DR level is crucial for maintaining appropriate challenge.

### DR Guidelines

| DR | Difficulty | When to Use | Example Tasks |
|----|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **0** | Trivial | Automatic success for anyone competent | Opening unlocked door, basic perception in clear conditions |
| **1** | Simple | Trained individuals succeed reliably | Hiding in shadows, climbing with handholds, basic first aid |
| **2** | Standard | The default for most challenges | Picking common locks, persuading neutral NPC, standard attack |
| **3** | Challenging | Requires expertise or luck | Disarming magical trap, deceiving suspicious guard, resisting potent spell |
| **4** | Severe | Near-impossible, legendary difficulty | Breaking ancient wards, surviving Elder God's attention, resisting fate itself |
| **5+** | Mythic | Should require multiple attempts or special preparation | Altering prophecy, defeating Pillar guardian, resisting direct divine influence |

### Factors That Modify DR

**Increase DR (+1 to +2) when:**
- Character is rushed or under pressure
- Working with unfamiliar tools or conditions
- Environmental hazards (darkness, unstable ground)
- Target actively resists (alert guard vs. sleeping one)
- Character has relevant disadvantage or condition

**Decrease DR (-1 to -2) when:**
- Character has ample time and resources
- Assistance from skilled ally
- Perfect conditions or specialized tools
- Target is vulnerable or compromised
- Character has relevant advantage

### DR in Combat vs. Non-Combat

**Combat:** Attacks are resolved against Defense Value (DV), not DR.
- DV = 1 + (higher of Shadow or Will) + modifiers
- Extra successes beyond DV create critical hits

**Non-Combat:** Use DR for all skill checks, saves, and challenges.
- Meeting DR = success
- Exceeding DR by 2+ = critical success (enhanced outcome)

---

## 1.2 Adjudicating Advantage and Disadvantage

The advantage/disadvantage system replaces situational bonuses. Here's when to apply each:

### When to Grant Advantage
**Roll normally, then re-roll all failures (1-4), adding new successes to total**

- Attacking from stealth or surprise
- High ground in combat
- Ally provides meaningful help
- Perfect tools or conditions for the task
- Target is unaware, restrained, or compromised
- Character has relevant perk or ability

### When to Impose Disadvantage
**Roll normally, then re-roll all successes (5-6), keeping only new results**

- Character is Blinded, Frightened, or Stunned
- Attacking in darkness without darkvision
- Terrible conditions (storm, earthquake)
- Improvised or broken tools
- Target has strong defensive advantage
- Character rushed or distracted

### Don't Stack
Multiple sources of advantage don't stack—you either have it or you don't. Same for disadvantage. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel out and roll normally.

### Example in Play
**Scenario:** A Dreadblade (Shadow 4, Stealth 3) attempts to sneak past a guard.

- **Base Roll:** 7 dice (4+3)
- **With Advantage** (moving through familiar shadows): Roll 7 dice → Result: 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1 (2 successes). Re-roll failures (4, 3, 3, 2, 1) → New rolls: 6, 5, 2, 1, 1 (2 more successes). **Total: 4 successes**
- **With Disadvantage** (guard is alert and scanning): Roll 7 dice → Result: 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1 (2 successes). Re-roll successes (6, 5) → New rolls: 3, 2 (0 new successes). **Total: 0 successes**

---

## 1.3 Critical Success vs. Critical Hit

Understanding the distinction between these two mechanics is essential:

### Critical Success (Skill Checks Only)
**Trigger:** 3+ total successes OR exceeding DR by 2+

**When it Happens:**
- Non-combat skill checks
- Saves against environmental hazards
- Social interactions
- Exploration and investigation

**Player Chooses One Benefit:**
- Gain additional information beyond the check's scope
- Complete task much faster than expected
- Create advantage for allies' next related action
- Avoid a complication that would normally occur
- Achieve an unexpectedly impressive result

**Example:** Picking a lock with Critical Success might also reveal who made the lock and what they were protecting.

### Critical Hit (Combat Only)
**Trigger:** 3+ total successes OR exceeding target's DV by 2+

**Player Chooses One Benefit:**
- **Bonus Damage:** +2 or +3 damage (GM decides cap)
- **Status Effect:** Inflict condition based on damage type (see Player's Handbook)
- **Bypass Armor:** Ignore 1 or 2 points of target's Armor
- **Tactical Advantage:** Create opening (target loses Reaction, ally gets advantage)

**Example:** Critical Hit with a piercing weapon might deal +3 damage AND inflict Bleeding (2 damage/round).

## 1.4 Handling Pushing Rolls

When players want to push a roll using Corruption:

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Player Declares Intent:** Must be before initial roll
2. **Verify Corruption Pool:** Check available Corruption Dice
3. **Calculate Cost:** Corruption Level ÷ 3 (rounded up) dice
4. **Roll Corruption Dice:** 1 = Taint, 2-4 = Neutral, 5-6 = Success
5. **Narrate the Corruption:** Make it feel meaningful
6. **Apply Results:** Add successes, enforce Taint consequences

### Handling Taint Results
When Corruption Dice roll 1s, impose immediate complications:

**Minor Taints (1-2 dice showing 1):**
- Unnatural physical sign (eyes glow, veins darken)
- NPCs nearby become uneasy or fearful
- Equipment gains corrupted appearance
- Temporary disadvantage on social checks

**Major Taints (3+ dice showing 1):**
- Attract unwanted attention (spectral predators, Sarafan)
- Corruption Level increases by 1
- Suffer Soul Drain (disadvantage on Will saves)
- Temporary loss of control (GM narrates brief dark impulse)

### Making Corruption Tempting
For the system to work, pushing rolls must feel worthwhile:
- Make critical moments hinge on single rolls
- Create scenarios where failure means disaster
- Show NPCs using corruption successfully
- Describe the rush of power gained
- Then enforce the costs dramatically

## 1.5 Managing Corruption

Track Corruption carefully—it's central to the game's themes:

### Tracking Corruption Level
Each character has a Corruption Level (0-15):
- **0-2:** Untouched
- **3-6:** Tier 1 Corrupted (Tier 1 perks available)
- **7-10:** Tier 2 Corrupted (Tier 2 perks available)
- **11-15:** Tier 3 Corrupted (Tier 3 perks available)

### Corruption Pool Management
- **Pool Size:** 2× Corruption Level in d6
- **Must Spend All:** Players MUST use all pool dice each session
- Creates urgency and temptation throughout play

### Ways to Gain Corruption
- Using forbidden magic or Hylden artifacts
- Making morally dark choices with mechanical benefit
- Feeding excessively (for vampires)
- Exposure to corrupted locations or entities
- Failing to resist corruption-causing effects
- Voluntary corruption to gain power quickly

### Narrating Corruption
Make corruption visible and meaningful:
- **Physical Signs:** Blackened veins, unnatural eye color, aura of wrongness
- **Behavioral Changes:** Increased aggression, paranoia, hunger
- **Environmental Reaction:** Shadows deepen, animals flee, plants wither
- **NPC Reactions:** Fear, distrust, or unnatural attraction

### Purification
See Chapter 6: Corruption Management for full details on purification methods.

## 1.6 Pacing Your Sessions

### The Three-Act Structure

**Act One: Setup (30-45 minutes)**
- Recap previous session
- Establish current situation
- Present immediate challenge or hook
- Allow character interaction and planning

**Act Two: Confrontation (60-90 minutes)**
- Main challenges and encounters
- Rising tension and complications
- Player choices with visible consequences
- Mix combat, exploration, and roleplay

**Act Three: Resolution (30-45 minutes)**
- Climactic encounter or major decision
- Immediate consequences of player actions
- Foreshadowing future complications
- End on dramatic note (resolution or cliffhanger)

### Mixing Encounter Types

Vary encounter types to maintain engagement:

**Combat Encounters (25-30% of session)**
- Tactical battles with interesting terrain
- Moral dilemmas (fight, flee, or negotiate?)
- Consequences beyond HP loss

**Exploration Encounters (25-30%)**
- Discovering lore and world details
- Environmental puzzles and hazards
- Navigating Material and Spectral Realms

**Social Encounters (25-30%)**
- Faction interactions and politics
- Information gathering
- Building alliances or making enemies

**Downtime (15-20%)**
- Character moments and roleplay
- Resource management
- Rest and recovery decisions

### Managing Energy
- **Start Strong:** Open with immediate action or choice
- **Vary Intensity:** Alternate high-tension with breathing room
- **End Memorably:** Finish on dramatic reveal or choice
- **Watch the Table:** Adjust based on player energy levels

## 1.7 The Rule of Cool

Sometimes the coolest narrative outcome is worth bending the rules:

### When to Invoke
- Player describes action cinematically
- Plan is creative but not mechanically optimal
- Moment would be memorable for everyone
- Following strict rules would diminish dramatic impact

### How to Apply
1. **Consider Intent:** What is the player trying to achieve?
2. **Assess Fairness:** Does this create unfair advantage?
3. **Set Stakes:** What's the cost of failure?
4. **Call for Roll:** Use appropriate attribute + skill
5. **Narrate Dramatically:** Make success/failure memorable

### Examples
- "I slide under the vampire's legs, stabbing upward as I pass"
- "I use my Wraith Phasing to appear behind the enemy just as my ally attacks from the front"
- "I carve a glyph mid-combat on the pillar to collapse it on the enemies"

**Ruling:** These are cool! Allow with appropriate skill checks, possibly at advantage if particularly creative.

## 1.8 Improvisation Tips

You can't prepare for everything. Here's how to improvise confidently:

### The "Yes, And..." Technique
When players do something unexpected:
1. **Accept It:** "Yes, you can try that..."
2. **Complicate It:** "...and the guard notices your movement"
3. **Call for Roll:** Determine appropriate skill check
4. **Improvise Outcome:** Based on success/failure and fiction

### Quick NPC Creation
Need an NPC on the spot?
1. **Pick a Voice/Mannerism:** Distinct characteristic
2. **Establish Motivation:** What do they want right now?
3. **Set Stats:** Use nearest similar NPC or estimate
4. **Name Later:** Can always add name afterwards

### Saying "Let Me Think"
It's okay to:
- Take a moment to consider ruling
- Ask player to describe their intent more clearly
- Consult rules briefly
- Defer complex ruling to break

Players prefer thoughtful decisions over rushed mistakes.

## 1.9 Common Rulings

### Surprise Rounds
- Attackers make Shadow + Stealth vs. targets' Focus + Observation
- Successful attackers get one free action before initiative
- Then roll initiative normally

### Falling Damage
- 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen (round up)
- Maximum 10d6 (100 feet)
- Some lineages/perks reduce or negate

### Concentration Checks
When caster takes damage while concentrating:
- Roll Will + Concentration vs. DR 2 (or DR based on damage)
- Failure = concentration broken, spell ends

### Drowning/Suffocation
- Can hold breath for Will × 10 seconds
- After that, DR 2 check each round (increasing by 1)
- Failure = unconscious, begin dying

### Vision and Lighting
- **Bright Light:** Normal vision, no penalties
- **Dim Light:** Disadvantage on Observation unless darkvision
- **Darkness:** Effectively Blinded unless darkvision or other senses

## 1.10 When Players Surprise You

### Player Agency
Embrace it when players:
- Create unexpected solutions
- Pursue goals you didn't anticipate
- Make choices that derail your plans
- Engage with world in unique ways

**Good GM Response:**
- "That's brilliant! Let's figure out how this works."
- Adapt your preparation to their direction
- Make their choices matter and have consequences

**Poor GM Response:**
- Railroading them back to your planned path
- Saying "you can't do that" without good reason
- Punishing creativity

### The 5-Minute Break
If players completely upend your plans:
1. Call a 5-minute break
2. Quickly reassess and adapt
3. Focus on "what happens next" not "back to plan"
4. Remember: Improvised sessions often become most memorable

*"The GM's role is not to defeat the players, but to challenge them. Not to control the story, but to facilitate it. Not to follow the rules religiously, but to use them to create drama."*
