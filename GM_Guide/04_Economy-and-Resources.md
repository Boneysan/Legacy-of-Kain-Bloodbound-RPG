## 4.1 The Collapse of Currency

### Why Traditional Money Doesn't Work

In the fractured world of Nosgoth:
- Central governments have collapsed
- Trade routes are dangerous or non-existent
- Gold and silver have limited practical value
- Survival needs trump abstract wealth
- Factional control determines access to resources

### What Has Value

Value is contextual, based on:
- **Immediate Need:** Water in a drought is priceless
- **Scarcity:** Rare items command higher value
- **Location:** Food abundant in one area, scarce in another
- **Faction:** Vampires value blood; humans value protection
- **Power:** Items that grant advantage

## 4.2 Barter System

### How Barter Works

Instead of fixed prices, trade involves:
1. **What You Have:** Resources, skills, information, allegiance
2. **What They Want:** What the other party values
3. **Negotiation:** Finding mutually beneficial exchange
4. **Trust:** Reputation and enforcement mechanisms

### Barter Values by Category

**Essential Survival Goods:**
- Clean water (1 day supply) = Small favor or useful information
- Preserved food (1 week) = Minor crafted item or tool
- Medicine/Healing herbs = Significant favor or rare component

**Crafted Goods:**
- Common weapon (sword, dagger) = 1 week food + water
- Quality armor (leather, chain) = 2 weeks food + weapon + service
- Masterwork item = Major favor + rare materials + substantial food

**Information & Services:**
- Basic rumor = Meal and drink
- Valuable intelligence = Week's supplies or minor item
- Safeguarding = Depends on duration and risk
- Skilled labor = Negotiated based on time and expertise

**Magical Components:**
- Common spell component = Day's supplies
- Rare reagent = Week's supplies or favor
- Powerful artifact material = Quest-level exchange
- Soul essence = Extremely high value (see Section 4.3)

## 4.3 Factional Currencies

### Vampire Society

**Blood as Currency:**

  - Vial of "pure" human blood = Minor favor between vampires
  - Blood from specific lineage = Significant trade good
  - Magically enhanced vitae = Rare commodity
- **Symbolic Value:**

## 4.4 Acquiring Equipment

### The Problem with Price Lists

In Nosgoth, there are no shops with price tags. Equipment acquisition is narrative and contextual.

### Equipment Acquisition Methods

**Method 1: Barter**

Player wants Iron Longsword. GM considers:
- **Location:** Are they in human settlement or vampire citadel?
- **Availability:** Are weapons common or scarce here?
- **Seller Needs:** What does the seller want?

**Example Exchange:**
"The blacksmith will forge you a longsword, but his daughter was taken by vampires three days ago. Bring her back alive, and the sword is yours. Plus whatever else you need for the rescue."

**Method 2: Crafting**

Requirements:
- Skill: Appropriate Craft skill rank
- Materials: Rare components for quality items
- Time: Hours to weeks depending on complexity
- Tools: Access to forge, workshop, or ritual space

**Example:**
- Iron Longsword: Craft skill 2, iron ingots, 2 days, basic forge
- Masterwork Armor: Craft skill 4, rare leather/metal, 2 weeks, expert tools

**Method 3: Salvage**

Finding equipment in ruins or taking from defeated enemies:
- Common gear: Easily found or scavenged
- Quality gear: Requires defeating worthy opponents
- Unique items: Major quest rewards or hidden caches

**Method 4: Faction Rewards**

Earning equipment through service:
- Complete quest for faction
- Gain rank within organization
- Prove loyalty and worth
- Receive equipment as reward or sign of status

**Example:**
"After defending the settlement from the vampire raid, the elder presents you with his father's Sarafan blade. 'You've earned the right to wield it against the darkness.'"

**Method 5: Quest Rewards**

Unique or powerful items tied to story:
- Find legendary weapon in ancient tomb
- Restore corrupted artifact to purity
- Inherit item from fallen mentor
- Discover hidden cache

## 4.5 Determining Fair Exchanges

### GM Guidelines for Barter

**Step 1: Establish Baseline Value**

Ask yourself:
- How common is this item?
- How useful is it in current context?
- What effort to obtain or create?
- What does seller need vs. want?

**Step 2: Consider Context**

Modify value based on:
- **Scarcity:** Rare in area increases value 2-3×
- **Need:** Desperate buyer increases value 2-4×
- **Relationship:** Trusted ally might give discount or credit
- **Risk:** Dangerous to obtain increases value
- **Time:** Urgent need increases value

**Step 3: Create Exchange Terms**

Options:
- **Goods for Goods:** Equal value trade
- **Goods for Service:** Quest or favor
- **Goods for Future:** IOU or ongoing arrangement
- **Goods for Information:** Valuable intelligence
- **Goods for Access:** Entry to restricted area

### Example Exchanges

**Common Iron Longsword:**
- 10 days of preserved food
- 3 days of protection service
- Minor quest (clear out nearby monster nest)
- Information about safe travel route
- 5 doses of medicine

**Quality Leather Armor:**
- 3 weeks food and water
- Common weapon + significant service
- Major quest (rescue kidnapped person)
- Rare healing herbs + 1 week food
- Alliance or oath of aid

**Masterwork Weapon:**
- Cannot simply buy; must earn through:
  - Major campaign quest
  - Defeating powerful enemy and claiming
  - Crafting with rare materials (quest for materials)
  - Significant faction rank achievement
  - Inheriting from fallen character

**Magical Relic:**
- Not for sale through normal means
- Acquisition requires:
  - Major story arc completion
  - Discovery in dangerous location

## 4.7 Tracking Wealth and Resources

### Party Inventory Management

**Important Resources to Track:**
- Food and water (in days of supply)
- Healing items (potions, herbs, bandages)
- Ammunition (arrows, bolts, throwing weapons)
- Tools and equipment
- Currency equivalents (trade goods)
- Favor IOUs (who owes party what)

**Don't Track:**
- Every mundane item
- Trivial consumables
- Items with no mechanical relevance
- Basic adventuring gear (rope, torches, etc.) unless scarcity matters

### When to Enforce Scarcity

**Always Track:**
- Food and water in wilderness or siege
- Healing resources during extended adventure
- Ammunition during sustained combat
- Special components for magic

**Sometimes Track:**
- Trade goods and wealth
- Favor IOUs and obligations
- Faction standing and access

**Rarely Track:**
- Basic equipment maintenance
- Trivial supplies in cities
- Clothing and mundane gear

### Creating Scarcity for Drama

Use resource scarcity to:
- Force difficult choices
- Create tension in survival situations
- Drive players toward specific goals
- Demonstrate world's harsh reality

**Example Scenarios:**
- Party must choose: Spend healing potion now or save for later?
- Running out of food in wilderness: Hunt (time/risk) or push on hungry?
- Need rare component: Which faction to ask (and what will they owe)?
- Out of ammunition: Use melee or flee from ranged advantage?

## 4.9 Example Transactions

### Scenario 1: Buying a Weapon

**Setup:** Party arrives at struggling human village. Need weapons.

**Blacksmith's Situation:**
- Has materials but no security
- Vampires raided recently
- Fears they'll return
- Daughter helps at forge

**GM Presentation:**
"The blacksmith looks at your coin purse and shakes his head. 'Gold won't feed my family if vampires drain us dry. You want weapons? Prove you can use them. Clear out the vampire nest in the old mill. Do that, and I'll forge whatever you need.'"

**Resolution Options:**
- Complete quest: Get weapons free + blacksmith's ongoing support
- Negotiate different service: Offer protection instead
- Provide different value: Rare materials reduce or eliminate quest requirement
- Show faction standing: Sarafan credentials might gain trust

### Scenario 2: Trading with Vampire

**Setup:** Party needs information about Pillar location. Vampire merchant might know.

**Vampire's Situation:**
- Values information and blood
- Ancient, calculating
- Has many debts owed
- Amused by mortals' audacity

**GM Presentation:**
"The vampire regards you with ancient eyes. 'The Pillar's location? Such knowledge has... value. I wonder what you might offer an immortal who has seen centuries pass? Gold means nothing. Blood... now blood has meaning. Or perhaps a favor? I have rivals who would benefit from... accidents.'"

**Resolution Options:**
- Blood payment: Vampire feeds from willing party member (HP loss + possible corruption)
- Favor owed: Vampire calls in favor later (plot hook)
- Rival elimination: Assassination quest
- Information trade: Party shares their knowledge
- Threat: Risky, might work with right Presence check or backup

### Scenario 3: Faction Quartermaster

**Setup:** Party earned standing with Sarafan Order. Seek equipment.

**Quartermaster's Situation:**
- Limited resources
- Many soldiers to equip
- Suspicious of outsiders
- Follows chain of command

**GM Presentation:**
"The quartermaster eyes your Sarafan medallion. 'You've proven your worth, and Commander vouches for you. We can spare some gear, but our soldiers come first. Choose wisely—one weapon and one armor piece each. Anything beyond that, you earn through service or provide yourself.'"

**Resolution:**
- Faction reward: Limited selection, earned through service
- Future access: Completing more missions improves standing
- Special requests: Major deeds might earn unique items
- Ongoing relationship: Regular small resupplies for active members
