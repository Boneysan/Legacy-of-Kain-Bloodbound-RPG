# Chapter 3: Mortals & Cultists

## Understanding Mortal Threats

In a world dominated by vampires, spectral horrors, and ancient evils, it's easy to forget that **mortals remain dangerous**. Humans in Nosgoth are survivors, zealots, and opportunists. Some have dedicated their lives to hunting the undead. Others have embraced forbidden powers in desperate bids for survival. Many have simply been driven mad by the world's endless horrors.

### Why Mortals Matter

**Tactical Intelligence**: Unlike mindless undead or bestial creatures, mortals use strategy, traps, and coordination. They adapt to player tactics and exploit weaknesses.

**Moral Complexity**: Killing a vampire is one thing; cutting down desperate refugees or misguided zealots is another. Mortal enemies force players to confront difficult choices.

**Corruption and Desperation**: Many mortals turn to blood magic, demon pacts, or Corruption to survive. They serve as cautionary tales of what happens when hope dies.

### Common Mortal Traits

**Fragile but Cunning**: Lower HP than monsters, but higher DR on saves and better tactics.

**Group Tactics**: Mortals rarely fight alone. They use formations, flanking, and coordinated strikes.

**Equipment Dependent**: Mortals rely on weapons, armor, and tools. Disarming or sundering their gear significantly weakens them.

**Morale**: Unlike undead, mortals can break. Killing their leader, destroying their icon, or inflicting massive casualties may cause them to flee.

## Creature Entries

### 1. Cult of the Abyss Fanatic

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Cultist)  
**Threat Tier**: Minion (TV 0.25)  
**Recommended Levels**: 1-4

#### Lore
The Cult of the Abyss worships the Elder God and the promise of oblivion. These zealots believe that reality is a prison and that only through the Wheel of Fate can souls find true purpose. Fanatics are the lowest rank—brainwashed initiates who throw themselves at enemies with reckless abandon, viewing death as transcendence.

They wear tattered robes marked with spiral sigils and carry crude weapons blessed in blood rituals. Their eyes are vacant, pupils dilated from hallucinogenic toxins used in cult ceremonies.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 10
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 2
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 1 (Will and Focus saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: None (robes)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 1
- Shadow: 2
- Will: 3 (indoctrinated)
- Focus: 1
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Melee (Crude Weapons): 1
- Fanaticism: 3
- Pain Tolerance: 2

#### Attacks
**Frenzied Strike** (Fury 2 + Melee 1 = 3d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 3 Physical damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the Fanatic screams a prayer that grants all nearby cultists +1 die on their next attack.

**Martyrdom Lunge** (Fury 2 + Fanaticism 3 = 5d6, once per encounter)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 5 Physical damage
- Effect: The Fanatic throws themselves at an enemy with suicidal abandon. If this attack would reduce the Fanatic to 0 HP (from reactions or opportunity attacks), they gain Advantage on the roll.

#### Abilities
**Cult Indoctrination**: Immune to fear effects. Automatically pass morale checks.

**Death Ecstasy**: When reduced to 0 HP, the Fanatic laughs maniacally and whispers a prayer. All allies within 10 feet gain +1 die on Will saves until the end of the encounter.

#### Tactics
- **Swarm Tactics**: Fanatics always attack in groups of 4-8. They surround isolated targets and use Martyrdom Lunge on the same turn to overwhelm defenses.
- **Fearless Advance**: They never retreat, even when outmatched. This makes them predictable but dangerous.
- **Sacrifice Play**: If a leader or important cultist is present, Fanatics will willingly take attacks meant for them.

#### Loot
- Crude weapon (club, dagger, or sickle) - **Trade Value**: 1 supply
- Spiral-marked robes - **Trade Value**: 2 supplies (to scholars or rival cults)
- Hallucinogenic mushrooms (1d3 doses) - **Trade Value**: 3 supplies per dose, can be used as poison or drug

---

### 2. Forsaken Priest of Light

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Fallen Cleric)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 3-7

#### Lore
Once, these were holy men and women who served the Circle of Nine, blessing the faithful and tending to the dying. When the Pillars collapsed and the world descended into darkness, many priests lost their faith. Some turned bitter and cynical. Others found new, darker powers willing to answer their prayers.

Forsaken Priests maintain the trappings of their former lives—holy symbols, robes, prayer books—but their blessings now carry curses, and their light has turned to shadow. They see themselves as realists who chose survival over sanctimony.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 24
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 3
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (all saves)
- **Movement**: 5 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Light (blessed robes, DR 1 vs Physical)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 1
- Soul: 4
- Shadow: 2
- Will: 4
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Divine Magic (Corrupted): 3
- Medicine: 2
- Intimidation: 2
- Holy Lore: 3

#### Attacks
**Corrupted Smite** (Soul 4 + Divine Magic 3 = 7d6)
- Range: 20 feet
- Damage: 4 Soul damage on success
- Effect: Target must pass a DR 2 Will save or be Shaken (Disadvantage on next attack roll).

**Dark Blessing** (Soul 4 + Divine Magic 3 = 7d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 30 feet (ally or self)
- Damage: None
- Effect: Grant one ally +2 dice on all rolls until the end of their next turn. That ally takes 2 Soul damage immediately (unavoidable).

**Mace of Broken Faith** (Fury 1 + Melee 1 = 2d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 3 Physical damage
- Effect: Basic melee attack. The Priest prefers to stay at range but can defend themselves if cornered.

#### Abilities
**Curse of the Fallen** (1/encounter): As a reaction when an enemy deals damage to the Priest, the Priest intones a curse. That enemy must pass a DR 2 Will save or suffer Disadvantage on their next roll.

**Ritual of Twisted Faith** (1/day): Spend 10 minutes performing a ritual. Choose one effect:
- Raise 1d3 Feralslave Ghouls (Minions, TV 0.25 each) to serve for 1 hour
- Heal all allies within 30 feet for 10 HP, but each takes 1 Corruption
- Place a Zone of Despair (20-foot radius) that inflicts -1 die to all enemy rolls while inside

**False Prophet**: The Priest can speak with divine authority, making Intimidation rolls with Advantage against faithful mortals.

#### Tactics
- **Support Role**: Forsaken Priests stay behind frontline cultists, using Dark Blessing to empower dangerous allies (like Witch-Hunters or Warlocks).
- **Cursed Defense**: When threatened, they use Curse of the Fallen to weaken attackers, then retreat behind allies.
- **Ritual Ambush**: If the party encounters the Priest before combat, they may have already used Ritual of Twisted Faith to prepare undead reinforcements or a Zone of Despair.

#### Loot
- Corrupted holy symbol - **Trade Value**: 10 supplies (to cultists), 5 supplies (to scholars)
- Blessed robes (Light armor, DR 1) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies
- Ritual components - **Trade Value**: 8 supplies
- Prayer book with crossed-out passages - **Trade Value**: 12 supplies (lore/history)

#### Scaling Options
**High Priest of Despair** (Elite, TV 2): +10 HP, +1 Soul, +1 Will, increase Divine Magic to 4. Add "Mass Curse" ability (affects all enemies within 20 feet).

---

### 3. Wandering Mad Seer

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Oracle)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 4-8

#### Lore
Time is broken in Nosgoth. The Time Streaming Chambers lie shattered, the Pillars have fallen, and the very fabric of causality frays at the edges. Some mortals, through tragedy or arcane accident, have become *temporally unmoored*. They see futures that may never be, pasts that never were, and presents that shift with each observation.

Mad Seers wander the wilderness, speaking in riddles and prophecies. Some are harmless madmen. Others are dangerous, their visions granting uncanny tactical awareness. A few serve as agents of Moebius, the Time Streamer, whether they know it or not.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 20
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4 (precognition)
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Will and Focus saves, representing mental fortitude)
- **Movement**: 5 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: None (tattered robes)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 1
- Soul: 4
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 4
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 1

**Skills**:
- Precognition: 4
- Arcane Lore: 3
- Evasion: 2
- Persuasion (unsettling): 2

#### Attacks
**Paradox Touch** (Soul 4 + Precognition 4 = 8d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 5 Soul damage on success
- Effect: Target experiences visions of their own death. They must pass a DR 3 Will save or be Stunned until the end of their next turn.

**Temporal Echo** (Focus 4 + Precognition 4 = 8d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Seer forces one enemy to relive the last 6 seconds. That enemy's last action is *undone* (movement, attack, spell, etc.), and they return to their previous position. Resources spent (SE, BP, etc.) are not refunded.

#### Abilities
**I've Seen This Before**: The Seer has Advantage on all Defense rolls. Once per encounter, they can negate a Critical Hit against them as a reaction (they "saw it coming" and moved at the last moment).

**Prophetic Warnings**: Once per round, as a reaction, the Seer can grant an ally within 30 feet Advantage on a Defense roll by shouting a warning ("Duck!" "Left side!" etc.).

**Fractured Timeline** (Passive): At the start of each of the Seer's turns, roll 1d6:
- **1-2**: The Seer is *Out of Phase* and cannot act this turn, but is immune to all damage.
- **3-5**: Normal turn.
- **6**: The Seer gets two actions this turn (or two uses of the same action).

**Cryptic Prophecy** (Once per encounter): The Seer speaks a prophecy that comes true within the next 3 rounds. The GM should make it ambiguous but mechanically relevant. Examples:
- "The tall one will fall before the moon rises." (One PC will be reduced to 0 HP within 3 rounds.)
- "Blood will open the path forward." (A blood sacrifice will reveal a hidden passage.)

#### Tactics
- **Evasive and Unpredictable**: The Seer uses high DV and Fractured Timeline to avoid damage. They're frustrating to pin down.
- **Temporal Echo Priority**: They use this ability to undo powerful attacks, healing spells, or tactical positioning by enemies.
- **Prophetic Warnings for Allies**: If accompanied by cultists or other mortals, the Seer's warnings make them much harder to hit.
- **Psychological Warfare**: Cryptic Prophecies unnerve players and create paranoia.

#### Loot
- Time-worn amulet (glows faintly, shows visions when held) - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies, can be used to ask the GM one "yes/no" question about the near future (once)
- Tattered scroll of prophecies - **Trade Value**: 12 supplies (lore)
- Chronocrystal shard (1d3 shards) - **Trade Value**: 8 supplies each, required component for time-based rituals

#### Scaling Options
**Chrono-Adept Seer** (Elite, TV 2): +8 HP, increase Precognition to 5. Replace Fractured Timeline with **Temporal Anchor**: The Seer can force one enemy per turn to reroll a successful attack or save (GM chooses the lower result).

---

### 4. Sarafan Inquisitor

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Holy Warrior)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 5-10

#### Lore
The Sarafan Order was founded to hunt vampires and purge Nosgoth of corruption. Clad in blessed armor and wielding silver-edged weapons, they are the most disciplined and dangerous mortal foes a vampire can face.

Inquisitors are veteran hunters who have slain dozens of vampires. They know the signs of undeath, the weaknesses of spectral creatures, and the rituals to banish demons. They are utterly ruthless, willing to burn entire villages suspected of harboring vampires.

However, the Sarafan's fanaticism often blinds them to nuance. They see only "pure" and "corrupt," and in their eyes, anyone who wields dark magic—even to fight greater evils—is damned.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 40
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 6
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (all saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Heavy (blessed plate armor, DR 3 vs Physical, DR 2 vs Soul/Necrotic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 3
- Shadow: 2
- Will: 4
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 3

**Skills**:
- Vampire Hunting: 4
- Swordplay: 4
- Intimidation: 3
- Holy Rites: 2

#### Attacks
**Silver Longsword** (Fury 4 + Swordplay 4 = 8d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical damage on success, 8 damage vs undead or vampires
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), inflict Burning (2 Radiant damage per turn, lasts 3 turns). Vampires have Disadvantage on rolls to extinguish Burning.

**Judgement Strike** (Fury 4 + Vampire Hunting 4 = 8d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 8 Physical + 4 Radiant damage
- Effect: This attack automatically bypasses any DR from armor or supernatural defenses. If the target is a vampire, they are also Branded (disadvantage on Stealth and Shadow-based rolls for 1 hour).

**Crossbow of Purity** (Focus 3 + Ranged Combat 2 = 5d6)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: 4 Physical damage, 6 damage vs undead
- Effect: Silvered bolts. On hit, target must pass a DR 2 Will save or be Marked (Inquisitor has Advantage on next attack against them).

#### Abilities
**Holy Ward**: The Inquisitor has Advantage on saves vs Necrotic, Soul, and Corruption effects. Spectral creatures cannot willingly enter a space within 5 feet of the Inquisitor unless they pass a DR 3 Will save.

**Vampire Slayer**: The Inquisitor knows vampiric weaknesses. They can identify vampires on sight and gain +2 dice on all rolls to detect, track, or fight undead.

**Purifying Prayer** (1/encounter): As an action, the Inquisitor prays for 6 seconds (one round). At the end of their next turn, all undead within 20 feet take 6 Radiant damage (no roll required) and must pass a DR 3 Will save or be Frightened (flee or cower) for 2 rounds.

**Unyielding Faith** (Reaction): When reduced to 0 HP for the first time in an encounter, the Inquisitor remains standing at 1 HP and immediately makes a free Silver Longsword attack.

#### Tactics
- **Identify Priority Targets**: Inquisitors focus fire on vampires, corrupted PCs, and undead. They largely ignore non-supernatural threats.
- **Judgement Strike for Big Threats**: They save Judgement Strike for dangerous vampires or corrupted spellcasters, using its armor-bypassing property to punish high-defense foes.
- **Purifying Prayer for Crowds**: If facing multiple undead, they'll use Purifying Prayer to blast an area.
- **Unyielding Faith Surprise**: Players often think they've won when the Inquisitor drops, only for them to spring back up for a retaliatory strike.

#### Loot
- Silver longsword (Melee weapon, +2 damage vs undead) - **Trade Value**: 35 supplies
- Blessed plate armor (Heavy, DR 3 Physical, DR 2 Soul) - **Trade Value**: 50 supplies
- Silvered crossbow bolts (10 bolts) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies
- Holy water (1d3 vials, deals 4 Radiant damage to undead on contact) - **Trade Value**: 8 supplies per vial
- Sarafan insignia (proves membership in the Order) - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies (to collectors), could grant access to Sarafan strongholds or cause hostility depending on PC actions

#### Scaling Options
**Sarafan Grand Inquisitor** (Boss, TV 4): +15 HP, increase Fury and Swordplay to 5. Add "Cleansing Flame" ability (60-foot cone, 8 Radiant damage to all undead, DR 4 Will save to halve). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Attack, or use Purifying Prayer.

### 5. Outcast Raider

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Bandit)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 2-6

#### Lore
Not all mortals are zealots or scholars. Some are simply survivors who prey on the weak. Outcast Raiders are bandits, exiles, and criminals who roam the wilderness in warbands, attacking travelers and looting villages.

They were cast out from civilized society for crimes ranging from theft to murder. In the lawless wastes of Nosgoth, they've formed brutal tribes led by the strongest and cruelest. They have no ideology beyond survival and greed.

Raiders are opportunistic. They ambush small groups, avoid fair fights, and retreat when outmatched. They're cowards at heart, but cornered cowards are dangerous.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 22
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 1 (all saves)
- **Movement**: 7 tiles per turn (unarmored)
- **Armor**: Light (leather and furs, DR 1 vs Physical)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 1
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 2
- Focus: 2
- Blood: 3

**Skills**:
- Ambush Tactics: 3
- Melee Combat: 2
- Survival: 2
- Intimidation: 1

#### Attacks
**Rusty Axe** (Fury 3 + Melee Combat 2 = 5d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 4 Physical damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target begins Bleeding (1 Physical damage per turn until they spend an action and pass a DR 1 Focus + Medicine check to stop it, or receive magical healing).

**Shortbow Ambush** (Focus 2 + Ambush Tactics 3 = 5d6)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: 3 Physical damage
- Effect: If the Raider is Hidden when they make this attack, they have Advantage on the roll.

#### Abilities
**Pack Mentality**: Raiders gain +1 die on attack rolls for each ally within 10 feet (max +3 dice).

**Cowardly Retreat**: When reduced below half HP, the Raider must pass a DR 2 Will save or spend their turn fleeing at double movement speed. If their leader is killed or if more than half their warband is dead, they automatically fail this save.

**Ambush Setup**: If the Raiders have time to prepare (ambushing travelers on a road, setting a trap in a canyon), they begin combat Hidden. PCs must pass a DR 2 Focus + Perception check to avoid being Surprised (lose first turn).

#### Tactics
- **Ambush from Range**: Raiders start Hidden and fire arrows from cover (trees, rocks, ruins). They only close to melee once enemies are wounded or outnumbered.
- **Surround and Overwhelm**: They use Pack Mentality to gang up on isolated targets.
- **Flee When Losing**: Raiders have no honor. If the fight turns against them, they scatter and run. Chasing them through wilderness is difficult.

#### Loot
- Rusty weapons (axes, daggers, bows) - **Trade Value**: 2 supplies each
- Leather armor - **Trade Value**: 5 supplies
- Stolen goods (random: 1d6 supplies worth of food, tools, trinkets)
- Map to raider camp (if interrogated or looted from leader)

#### Scaling Options
**Veteran Raider** (TV 1.5): +6 HP, increase Fury and Melee Combat to 3. Replace Cowardly Retreat with "Last Stand" (when below half HP, gain +2 dice on attacks instead of fleeing).

**Raider Chieftain** (Elite, TV 2): +12 HP, increase Fury to 4, Ambush Tactics to 4. Add "Warlord's Command" ability (once per turn, grant an ally Advantage on their next attack roll). Chieftains never flee while their warband lives.

---

### 6. Black Rune Warlock

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Dark Sorcerer)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 6-12

#### Lore
Some mortals turn to forbidden magic out of desperation. Others seek power for its own sake. Black Rune Warlocks are the latter—ambitious sorcerers who have delved into Hylden rituals, blood magic, and demon summoning.

They inscribe runes on their skin and tattoos on their flesh, each symbol a conduit for arcane power. The cost is steep: every spell burns the body from within, and every ritual inches the Warlock closer to becoming something inhuman.

Black Rune Warlocks serve no master but themselves. They may ally with cults, vampires, or Hylden agents, but only when it serves their goals. They are cunning, paranoid, and utterly ruthless.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 32
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Will and Soul saves), 2 (Physical saves)
- **Movement**: 5 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: None (robes), but protected by **Runic Shielding** (see Abilities)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 5
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 4
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Black Rune Magic: 4
- Ritual Casting: 3
- Arcane Lore: 3
- Intimidation: 2

#### Attacks
**Void Bolt** (Soul 5 + Black Rune Magic 4 = 9d6)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: 6 Soul damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is Cursed (Disadvantage on their next roll).

**Hylden Flame** (Soul 5 + Black Rune Magic 4 = 9d6, costs 2 SE)
- Range: 30-foot cone
- Damage: 5 Fire damage to all creatures in the cone
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 3 Shadow save or also be Burning (2 Fire damage per turn for 3 turns).

**Rune of Torment** (Soul 5 + Black Rune Magic 4 = 9d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: 8 Soul damage
- Effect: The target must pass a DR 3 Will save or be Stunned until the end of their next turn as agony wracks their mind.

#### Abilities
**Runic Shielding**: The Warlock's runes flare when attacked, granting DR 2 against all damage types. However, each time the Warlock takes damage, they lose 1 SE as the runes consume energy to protect them.

**Blood Price**: The Warlock can spend HP instead of SE to cast spells. For every 2 HP spent, gain 1 SE. This can be used even when the Warlock has 0 SE remaining.

**Demon Summoning** (1/day, requires 10-minute ritual): The Warlock summons a **Chainmaw Demon** (Standard, TV 1, from Demonic chapter) to serve them for 1 hour. The demon obeys commands but is hostile and will attack the Warlock if they show weakness.

**Rune of Warding** (Reaction, 1/encounter): When targeted by an attack, the Warlock can activate a warding rune. They teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space they can see, and the attack misses automatically.

#### Tactics
- **Open with Area Damage**: Warlocks start with Hylden Flame to soften up groups, then follow up with Void Bolt on priority targets.
- **Runic Shielding Management**: They monitor their SE carefully. If running low, they use Blood Price to sacrifice HP for more casting power.
- **Rune of Warding for Defense**: They save this reaction for powerful attacks or spells, teleporting away and forcing enemies to reposition.
- **Demon Summoning for Reinforcements**: If prepared (and the GM allows), the Warlock may have already summoned a demon before combat begins.
- **Rune of Torment for Controllers**: They use this to Stun enemy spellcasters, healers, or leaders, disrupting coordination.

#### Loot
- Black rune grimoire (spellbook, contains 1d3 rituals) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies, can be studied to learn rituals (requires Corruption roll)
- Runic focus (carved obsidian wand, +1 die to spellcasting rolls) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies
- Demon summoning circle (chalk and sigils, one-time use) - **Trade Value**: 25 supplies, can summon a lesser demon
- Blood vials (1d3 vials, can be used for Blood Price without harming self) - **Trade Value**: 10 supplies each

#### Scaling Options
**Archwarlock of the Black Rune** (Boss, TV 4): +20 HP, increase Soul to 6, Black Rune Magic to 5. Add "Mass Curse" ability (all enemies within 30 feet gain Disadvantage on next roll). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Cast Void Bolt, Teleport 20 feet, or Summon Demon (costs 2 actions).

---

### 7. Bleeding Eye Assassin

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Contract Killer)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 7-13

#### Lore
The Bleeding Eye is a guild of assassins who operate in the shadows of Nosgoth's cities. They are mercenaries who kill for coin, information, or favors. Clients leave contracts at hidden drop points, and the guild assigns assassins based on difficulty.

Bleeding Eye Assassins are masters of infiltration, poison, and precision strikes. They wear masks marked with a single red eye—a warning to their targets. They never speak, never negotiate, and never leave witnesses.

They are not inherently evil, merely professional. Some even claim to follow a code: they only kill their contracted target and avoid collateral damage. Whether this is honor or pragmatism is unclear.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 38
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 7 (agile and trained to evade)
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Shadow and Focus saves), 2 (other saves)
- **Movement**: 8 tiles per turn (light armor, acrobatic)
- **Armor**: Light (dark leathers, DR 1 vs Physical)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 1
- Shadow: 5
- Will: 3
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Assassination: 5
- Stealth: 5
- Acrobatics: 4
- Poison Craft: 3

#### Attacks
**Assassin's Blade** (Shadow 5 + Assassination 5 = 10d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 7 Physical damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is Bleeding (2 Physical damage per turn) and Poisoned (Disadvantage on attacks and saves, lasts 3 turns).

**Poisoned Dart** (Focus 4 + Assassination 5 = 9d6)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: 3 Physical damage + Poison
- Effect: Target must pass a DR 3 Blood save or be Poisoned (Disadvantage on attacks and saves, lasts 5 turns). The dart can be thrown silently while Hidden without revealing the Assassin's position.

**Coup de Grace** (Shadow 5 + Assassination 5 = 10d6, only usable when Hidden or vs Stunned/Sleeping targets)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 15 Physical damage on success (ignores armor)
- Effect: This attack automatically has Advantage. On Critical Hit, the target is reduced to 0 HP immediately (no death saves unless they have special abilities).

#### Abilities
**Shadow Step**: As a bonus action, the Assassin can teleport up to 15 feet to any shadowed area they can see, and immediately become Hidden. This can be used once per turn.

**Master of Stealth**: The Assassin has Advantage on all Stealth rolls. While Hidden, they are immune to area-of-effect attacks (they slip between the blasts).

**Evasion**: When the Assassin would take damage from an attack, they can use a reaction to attempt a Shadow + Acrobatics roll (10d6) against the attacker's successes. If the Assassin rolls more successes, they take no damage (they dodged).

**Contract Kill** (Passive): At the start of the encounter, the Assassin designates one PC as their "contract target." They deal +2 damage on all attacks against that target and have Advantage on Stealth rolls when sneaking toward them.

#### Tactics
- **Stealth Opening**: Assassins begin combat Hidden. They use Shadow Step to reach isolated targets and attempt Coup de Grace on sleeping or Stunned victims.
- **Poisoned Dart Harassment**: If they can't get close safely, they fire Poisoned Darts from cover, using the Poison effect to weaken priority targets.
- **Evasion for Survival**: When attacked, they use Evasion to negate damage, then Shadow Step away to reset Stealth.
- **Contract Kill Focus**: They relentlessly pursue their designated target, ignoring others unless threatened. This makes them predictable but deadly to the marked PC.
- **Retreat on Failure**: If their contract target survives and they're reduced below 10 HP, Assassins will flee using Shadow Step and report failure to the guild.

#### Loot
- Assassin's blade (dagger, +1 die on attacks when Hidden) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies
- Poison vials (1d3 doses, inflict Poisoned for 5 turns on weapon coating) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies per dose
- Bleeding Eye mask - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies (proves guild membership, could grant access or cause hostility)
- Contract scroll (details the target, client, and payment) - **Trade Value**: Priceless for story purposes (reveals who hired the assassin)

#### Scaling Options
**Bleeding Eye Master Assassin** (Boss, TV 4): +15 HP, increase Shadow and Assassination to 6. Add "Mark for Death" ability (all allies gain +2 dice on attacks vs the marked target). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Shadow Step, Poisoned Dart, or Evasion.

### 8. Witch-Hunter Commander

**Type**: Mortal Humanoid (Military Leader)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 8-14

#### Lore
Where Sarafan Inquisitors hunt vampires with holy zeal, Witch-Hunter Commanders hunt *magic users* with military precision. They are soldiers, not priests, and they view sorcery as a disease to be eradicated.

Witch-Hunter Commanders lead squads of mortal soldiers and specialists. They are master tacticians who use anti-magic equipment, coordinated strikes, and brutal efficiency to bring down even powerful mages. They show no mercy to those who wield forbidden arts.

Their armor is inscribed with runes designed to disrupt magic. Their weapons are forged to cut through magical barriers. They are the bane of Warlocks, Cultists, and corrupted spellcasters.

#### Stats

- **Defense Value (DV)**: 6
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (all saves, trained resilience)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Heavy (rune-inscribed plate, DR 3 vs Physical, DR 2 vs Magic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 2
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 4
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 3

**Skills**:
- Tactics: 4
- Anti-Magic Combat: 4
- Swordplay: 3
- Leadership: 4

#### Attacks
**Rune-Etched Longsword** (Fury 4 + Swordplay 3 = 7d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target loses 2 SE and cannot cast spells until the end of their next turn (runes disrupt magical energy).

- Range: Melee
- Damage: 8 Physical damage, +4 damage vs spellcasters
- Effect: This attack ignores any magical defenses (barriers, shields, wards). If the target has SE, they lose 4 SE in addition to HP damage.

**Crossbow Command** (Focus 4 + Tactics 4 = 8d6, once per turn)
- Range: 50 feet
- Damage: None directly
- Effect: The Commander designates a target and orders nearby soldiers to fire. All allied archers/crossbowmen within 40 feet immediately make a ranged attack against the designated target with Advantage.

#### Abilities
**Tactical Leader**: All allies within 30 feet of the Commander gain +1 die on attack rolls and automatically pass morale checks. If the Commander is killed, all mortal allies must pass a DR 3 Will save or be Frightened (flee or cower) for 2 rounds.

**Anti-Magic Aura**: The Commander's armor disrupts magic within 15 feet. All enemy spells cast within this aura have Disadvantage on their rolls. Magical healing is halved within the aura.

**Counter-Spell Strike** (Reaction, 1/encounter): When an enemy within reach casts a spell, the Commander can immediately make a free Rune-Etched Longsword attack as a reaction. If the attack hits, the spell is interrupted and fails (SE is still spent).

**Unyielding Commander**: The first time per encounter the Commander would be reduced to 0 HP, they remain standing at 1 HP and gain +2 dice on all attacks for 2 rounds (adrenaline surge).

#### Tactics
- **Lead from the Front**: Commanders charge into melee against spellcasters, using Anti-Magic Aura to disrupt their abilities.
- **Counter-Spell Strike for Interruption**: They save this reaction for high-cost spells (like rituals or powerful attacks), interrupting them at critical moments.
- **Crossbow Command for Focus Fire**: They coordinate ranged attacks to eliminate wounded enemies or soften up tough targets before closing.
- **Mage Breaker Strike for Casters**: They prioritize using this ability on enemy spellcasters to drain SE and prevent magical counterattacks.
- **Tactical Leader Synergy**: They position themselves to maximize the buff radius, keeping their squad empowered.

#### Loot
- Rune-etched longsword (Melee weapon, +2 dice vs spellcasters) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies
- Rune-inscribed plate armor (Heavy, DR 3 Physical, DR 2 Magic) - **Trade Value**: 60 supplies
- Witch-Hunter insignia (grants access to Witch-Hunter strongholds) - **Trade Value**: 25 supplies (or story leverage)
- Anti-magic manacles (magical restraints, prevents spellcasting while worn) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies

#### Scaling Options
**Witch-Hunter General** (Boss, TV 4): +20 HP, increase Fury and Tactics to 5. Add "Arcane Nullification Zone" ability (60-foot radius, all spells have Disadvantage and cost +1 SE). Add 3 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Attack, Crossbow Command, or Rally Troops (remove Frightened from all allies).

## Combat Tactics & Encounter Design

### Using Mortals Effectively

**Mix Threat Tiers**: Combine Minions (Fanatics) with Elites (Inquisitors, Assassins) to create layered encounters. Minions soak damage and control space, while Elites deliver killing blows.

**Environmental Advantages**: Mortals are smart. They use cover, high ground, chokepoints, and traps. Ambushes in forests, rooftop battles in cities, and fortress sieges all favor mortal tactics.

**Morale Matters**: Unlike undead, mortals can break. Killing their leader, destroying their icon (holy symbol, warband banner), or inflicting massive casualties may cause them to flee.

**Moral Dilemmas**: Mortals are *people*. Some are misguided, desperate, or coerced. Players may hesitate to kill them, especially if they're defending their homes or families. Use this for narrative tension.

### Sample Encounters

#### Encounter 1: Ambush on the Road (Levels 2-4)
**Setup**: The party travels through a forest when they're ambushed by 6 **Outcast Raiders** (Standard, TV 1 each, TV 6 total) and 1 **Raider Chieftain** (Elite, TV 2, TV 8 total adjusted).

**Tactics**: Raiders start Hidden in trees and bushes. They fire arrows (Shortbow Ambush) for 2 rounds, then charge with axes when enemies are wounded. The Chieftain uses Warlord's Command to empower the strongest raider.

**Twist**: If the party defeats the raiders quickly, the Chieftain offers information (location of a nearby ruin, warning about a vampire nest) in exchange for his life.

---

#### Encounter 2: The Heretic's Pyre (Levels 3-5)
**Setup**: A **Forsaken Priest of Light** (Standard, TV 1) has raised 3 **Feralslave Ghouls** (Minions, TV 0.25 each) using Ritual of Twisted Faith. He's holed up in a ruined chapel, surrounded by 8 **Cult of the Abyss Fanatics** (Minions, TV 0.25 each). Total TV: ~4.

**Tactics**: Fanatics form a defensive line at the chapel entrance, using Martyrdom Lunge to soften up intruders. Ghouls swarm isolated PCs. The Priest stays in the back, using Dark Blessing on Ghouls and Corrupted Smite on casters.

**Environmental Factor**: The chapel has a central brazier. If knocked over (requires a Fury + Athletics roll, DR 2), it spreads fire across the room, dealing 3 Fire damage per turn to all creatures inside.

**Twist**: The Priest carries a letter revealing he's working for a local noble who wants to destabilize the region.

---

#### Encounter 3: The Contract (Levels 7-9)
**Setup**: A **Bleeding Eye Assassin** (Elite, TV 2) has been hired to kill one PC. The assassin ambushes the party while they rest at an inn.

**Tactics**: The Assassin infiltrates during the night, attempting Coup de Grace on the sleeping target. If the PC wakes (DR 3 Focus + Perception check to detect), the Assassin fights for 3 rounds, then Shadow Steps out a window to escape if below 15 HP.

**Twist**: If captured alive, the Assassin reveals who hired them (a rival faction, a betrayed ally, or a mysterious patron). If killed, the contract scroll on their body provides the same information.

**Follow-Up**: The guild will send another assassin unless the party deals with the original client or negotiates with the guild.

---

#### Encounter 4: The Witch-Hunter Raid (Levels 8-10)
**Setup**: A **Witch-Hunter Commander** (Elite, TV 2) leads 4 **Sarafan Inquisitors** (Elite, TV 2 each, TV 8 total) and 6 **Outcast Raiders** (conscripted militia, Minions). Total TV: ~11-12.

**Tactics**: The Commander uses Crossbow Command to focus fire on the party's spellcaster. Inquisitors close to melee, using Silver Longswords and Judgement Strike. Raiders provide flanking support and absorb counterattacks.

**Environmental Factor**: The battle takes place in a town square. Civilians are present and may be caught in crossfire. Killing civilians causes Corruption and turns the town against the party.

**Twist**: The Witch-Hunters believe the party is harboring a dangerous Warlock (which may be true if a PC uses Corrupted Perks). The Commander is willing to negotiate if the party surrenders the "Warlock" or proves their innocence.

## Integrating Mortals into Your Campaign

### Factions and Allegiances

**Sarafan Order**: Vampire hunters, holy warriors, and zealots. They view all dark magic as corrupt and will hunt PCs who use Necrotic spells or Corrupted Perks.

**Cult of the Abyss**: Worshipers of the Elder God. They seek to hasten the collapse of Nosgoth and the return of the Wheel. They may ally with vampires who serve the Elder God's will.

**Witch-Hunter Guild**: Militaristic anti-magic enforcers. They hunt sorcerers, cultists, and corrupted individuals regardless of alignment.

**Bleeding Eye Assassins**: Neutral mercenaries. They work for the highest bidder and have no ideology beyond profit.

**Outcast Warbands**: Chaotic bandits. They'll ally with anyone who pays or intimidates them, but they're unreliable.

### Moral Complexity

**Not All Mortals Are Evil**: Many are victims of circumstance. The Forsaken Priest may have lost faith after watching his entire congregation slaughtered. The Outcast Raider may be a refugee driven to banditry by starvation.

**Player Choices Matter**: Killing mortals should have consequences. Towns remember. Factions react. The party's reputation spreads.

**Redemption Arcs**: Captured mortals can become allies, informants, or even companions. A repentant Cult Fanatic or a pardoned Raider can provide unique story opportunities.

---

## Story Hooks

### The Heretic's Confession
A **Forsaken Priest** approaches the party, claiming he wants to atone for his crimes. He offers information about a cult ritual in exchange for protection. Is he sincere, or is this a trap?

### The Bleeding Eye Contract
The party discovers a contract scroll on a dead **Bleeding Eye Assassin**. The target? One of them. Who hired the guild, and why? Can they negotiate with the guild, or must they go to war?

### The Sarafan Crusade
A **Witch-Hunter Commander** has declared the party's home village a "nest of corruption" and plans to burn it to the ground. The party must stop the crusade, prove the town's innocence, or evacuate everyone before the raid.

### The Mad Seer's Warning
A **Wandering Mad Seer** stumbles into the party's camp, raving about a coming doom. Their prophecies are vague but seem tied to the party's recent actions. Is this madness, or genuine precognition?

### The Warlock's Bargain
A **Black Rune Warlock** offers the party forbidden knowledge (a powerful ritual, the location of an artifact) in exchange for a favor: retrieve a component from a dangerous ruin, or eliminate a rival sorcerer. Can they trust the Warlock, or will they be betrayed?

## GM Guidance: Running Mortal Encounters

### Tactics Over Stats
Mortals are defined by their intelligence. They use terrain, traps, and teamwork. Don't just have them charge mindlessly.

### Show Humanity
Give mortals names, voices, and motivations. A nameless bandit is forgettable. "Gregor the Scarred, who's stealing to feed his sick daughter" is memorable.

### Use Morale
When half the mortals are dead or their leader falls, have them make DR 3 Will saves. Failures mean they flee or surrender. This makes combat dynamic and rewards strategic play.

### Consequences for Violence
If the party slaughters every mortal they meet, word spreads. Towns close their gates. Merchants refuse to trade. The Sarafan declares them outlaws.

### Opportunities for Diplomacy
Not every encounter needs to end in bloodshed. Mortals can be reasoned with, bribed, or intimidated. Players who think creatively should be rewarded.

## Legendary Actions for Mortal Bosses

When running **Elite** or **Boss**-tier mortals in climactic encounters, consider giving them **Legendary Actions** to represent their exceptional skill and battlefield presence.

### How Legendary Actions Work
- The mortal has **2-3 Legendary Actions per round** (depending on their importance).
- Legendary Actions can be used at the end of another creature's turn (not the mortal's own turn).
- Each Legendary Action counts as one use unless specified otherwise (e.g., "costs 2 actions").
- Legendary Actions reset at the start of the mortal's next turn.

### Sample Legendary Actions for Mortals

**For Sarafan Inquisitors or Witch-Hunter Commanders**:
- **Move**: The mortal moves up to half their movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Strike**: The mortal makes one melee attack.
- **Holy Command** (costs 2 actions): The mortal shouts a prayer, granting all allies within 30 feet +1 die on their next attack roll.
- **Purging Light** (costs 2 actions, Inquisitor only): The mortal holds their holy symbol aloft, dealing 4 Radiant damage to all undead within 20 feet (no roll).

**For Black Rune Warlocks**:
- **Teleport**: The mortal teleports up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.
- **Cantrip**: The mortal casts a minor spell (Void Bolt at reduced dice, 4d6 instead of 9d6).
- **Runic Barrier** (costs 2 actions): The mortal creates a magical barrier, granting themselves +2 DV and DR 2 until the start of their next turn.

**For Bleeding Eye Assassins**:
- **Shadow Step**: The mortal teleports up to 15 feet to a shadowed area and becomes Hidden.
- **Poisoned Dart**: The mortal makes a ranged attack with Poisoned Dart.
- **Evasion** (costs 2 actions): The mortal uses their Evasion ability as described in their stat block.

**For Wandering Mad Seers**:
- **Prophetic Warning**: The mortal shouts a warning, granting one ally within 30 feet Advantage on their next Defense roll.
- **Temporal Flicker**: The mortal phases out of reality until the start of their next turn, becoming immune to all damage and effects.
- **Glimpse the Future** (costs 2 actions): The mortal predicts an enemy's next action, granting the mortal Advantage on their next attack or save against that enemy.
