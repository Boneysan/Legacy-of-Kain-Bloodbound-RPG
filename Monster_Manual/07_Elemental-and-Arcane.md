# Chapter 7: Elemental & Arcane

*Where raw magical energy takes monstrous form, and the very elements rise to kill.*

## Introduction

The energies that flow through Nosgoth are not always benign. In places where the veil between realms is thin, or where catastrophic magical events have occurred, raw power can coalesce into sentient, often hostile, forms. These are the elementals—beings of pure fire, ice, lightning, or shadow—and the arcane horrors that defy sane categorization. They are not born, but made; not living, but manifest.

This chapter details the entities born from Nosgoth’s magical lifeblood. From the raging Fire-Spite Djinn bound in ancient ruins to the chilling Frost-Touched Revenants that haunt frozen battlefields, these creatures represent a direct and often unpredictable threat. They are forces of nature given will and purpose, their logic alien and their power immense. Slaying such a creature is less like hunting an animal and more like trying to extinguish a star or halt a storm.

### Attacks & Abilities

**1. Cinder Strike (Basic Attack)**

- **Dice Pool:** Fury (6) + 3 vs. Dodge
- **Damage:** 10 Fire Damage. On hit, the target gains 1 stack of **Immolate**.
- **Immolate:** Target takes 2 Fire damage at the start of their turn. Stacks up to 5 times. Can be doused with an Action and a successful Willpower check (DC 12) or by taking Cold damage.

**2. Emberstorm (Area of Effect)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Cost:** 5 SE
- **Range:** 30ft radius sphere, centered on the Djinn
- **Dice Pool:** Fury (6) + 2 vs. Agility
- **Effect:** All creatures within the area must defend. On a failed defense, they take 12 Fire damage and gain 1 stack of **Immolate**. On a success, they take half damage and no Immolate.

**3. Infernal Binding (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** The Fire-Spite Djinn is bound to a specific object or a small area (e.g., a brazier, a throne, a single room). It cannot move more than 100 feet from its anchor. If its anchor is destroyed (Health 50, Armor 10), the Djinn is immediately banished.

**4. Heat Wave (Aura)**
- **Passive**
- **Range:** 10ft radius
- **Effect:** Any creature that starts its turn within the aura takes 3 Fire damage. The area is considered difficult terrain for any creature not immune to Fire.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** Fire-Spite Djinn are echoes of powerful fire elementals or Ifrit-like beings that were trapped or slain with powerful binding magic. What remains is not the original intelligence, but a nexus of raw elemental fury and a burning hatred for the confinement. They are often used as unwilling guardians for ancient tombs or sorcerous vaults, their rage ensuring no one can pass.

**Behavior:** The Djinn is a being of pure rage. It will immediately attack any creature that enters its domain, using Emberstorm to soften up groups before focusing on the closest or most threatening target with Cinder Strikes. It has no sense of self-preservation and will fight until its anchor is destroyed or all intruders are incinerated.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** The key is to identify the anchor. A successful **Arcana** or **Investigation (Focus)** check (DC 15) will reveal the source of the Djinn's binding. While some party members keep the Djinn occupied, others must focus their attacks on the anchor. Cold-based attacks are highly effective, as they can slow the Djinn and reduce its damage output. Dousing the **Immolate** effect is crucial to prevent accumulating damage.

**For the GM:** The Djinn is a localized, high-damage threat. Use its Heat Wave and Emberstorm to pressure the entire party. It will not pursue fleeing characters beyond its boundary, but will instead return to its anchor, ready to re-engage. If the players are struggling, hint at the anchor's significance by having the Djinn react with unusual fury when it is damaged.

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Elemental Heart of Fire:** A core of solidified flame. Can be used by a skilled artisan to craft a weapon that deals +5 Fire damage on hit, or an amulet that grants Fire Resistance.
- **Essence of Rage:** Can be distilled into a potion that grants +2 Fury for one hour.
- **Binding Runes:** If the anchor is studied before destruction (requires an hour and a successful Arcana check, DC 18), the character can learn a ritual to temporarily bind an elemental of their own.

---

### Scaling Options

- **Threat Value 15 (Major):** Increase Health to 120 and Armor to 6. **Cinder Strike** now deals 14 damage. **Emberstorm** costs 8 SE and deals 16 damage. Gains a new ability: **Detonation (Reaction)** - When reduced to 0 Health (but its anchor is intact), it explodes. All creatures within 30ft must make an Agility save (DC 16) or take 25 Fire damage.
- **Threat Value 18 (Deadly):** As above, but gains a Legendary Action. It can use **Cinder Strike** at the end of another creature's turn (1/round). Its **Heat Wave** aura now also reduces incoming healing to creatures within it by 50%.

---

## Spiritbound Flame Wolf

*A large, spectral wolf wreathed in ethereal fire, its howls echoing with the crackle of a dying fire. It is a hunter, bound not by rage, but by a lingering, sorrowful duty.*

- **Dice Pool:** Soul (5) + 3 vs. Dodge

**3. Ethereal Stride (Movement Ability)**

- **Cost:** 4 SE
- **Effect:** The Spiritbound Flame Wolf becomes invisible and can immediately move up to its full movement speed. The invisibility lasts until the start of its next turn or until it makes an attack.

**4. Pack Hunter's Sorrow (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** If the Spiritbound Flame Wolf is the only hostile creature engaged in combat, it gains +2 to all its attack dice pools. If it is fighting alongside allies, it instead gains +2 to its Armor as it coordinates its movements.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** These are not true elementals, but the spirits of great wolves or loyal hunting beasts that died in a place of immense magical power, often in a great fire. Their spirits were infused with elemental energy, binding them to their territory. They are often found guarding ancient druidic sites or the ruins of a sorcerer's tower, still loyal to a master long dead. Their sorrow is palpable, a constant, low-burning grief that fuels their spectral flames.

**Behavior:** The Flame Wolf is a patient and tactical hunter. It will often begin an encounter with Ethereal Stride to position itself advantageously, followed by a Soulfire Howl to weaken spellcasters and other resource-heavy characters. It then picks a target, often the one who seems most spiritually or magically potent, and relentlessly pursues them with Phantom Bites. It is not mindlessly aggressive and will retreat if seriously threatened, using its speed and stealth to escape and re-engage on its own terms.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** This is a skirmisher, not a brute. Spreading out can mitigate the effectiveness of its Soulfire Howl. Characters with high Willpower should be on the front lines to resist its debuffs. Tracking it when it uses Ethereal Stride is key; abilities that reveal invisible creatures or area-of-effect attacks can force it back into the open. Because of its Pack Hunter's Sorrow, either focus it down immediately when it's alone or be prepared to deal with its increased defenses if it has allies.

**For the GM:** Use the Flame Wolf's mobility. Have it appear, strike, and vanish. Its goal is to disrupt the party's backline and drain their resources. Pair it with other creatures, like Glyphfire Sprites or even mortal cultists, to activate its defensive buff and create a more complex encounter. Its sorrowful nature can also be a roleplaying hook—perhaps it can be pacified or its duty fulfilled without combat.

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Heart of Spectral Flame:** A flickering, intangible ember. Can be used to grant a weapon the "Ethereal" property for 1 hour, allowing it to strike incorporeal creatures as if they were solid.
- **Wolf's Loyalty (Essence):** When consumed, grants the user advantage on all checks to resist being charmed or frightened for 24 hours.
- **Sorrowful Howl (Scroll):** A rare scroll containing the Soulfire Howl ability. A character with sufficient Arcana can attempt to scribe it into their own spellbook.

---

### Scaling Options

- **Threat Value 12 (Major):** Increase Health to 90 and SE to 60. **Phantom Bite** now deals 10 Fire + 6 Soul damage. **Soulfire Howl** now affects a 30ft cone. Gains **Pack Alpha** passive: all allied beasts or elementals within 30ft deal an extra 3 damage with their attacks.
- **Threat Value 16 (Deadly):** As above, but **Ethereal Stride** is now a free action (1/round). When it successfully hits with a **Phantom Bite**, it can immediately attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action, its spectral jaws locking onto their soul. Escaping requires a contested Soul vs. Willpower check.

---

## Bloodhail Cyclone

*A swirling vortex of wind, razor-sharp ice shards, and corrupted blood magic. It is a localized, unnatural storm that drains the life from the land and its inhabitants.*

**Threat Value:** 14 (Major)

### Attacks & Abilities

**1. Flensing Shards (Basic Attack)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 20ft
- **Dice Pool:** Shadow (6) + 4 vs. Dodge
- **Damage:** 12 Physical (Slashing) Damage and 5 Cold Damage. The target begins **Bleeding**, taking 3 damage at the start of their turn until they receive healing or spend an action to staunch the wound.

**2. Sanguine Vortex (Aura / Active Ability)**
- **Action:** 1 Action to activate or deactivate
- **Cost:** 10 SE to activate
- **Range:** 20ft radius aura
- **Effect:** The area around the cyclone becomes a maelstrom of bloody ice. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura takes 5 Cold damage and must make a Fury check (DC 14) or be pulled 10ft closer to the cyclone. While active, the cyclone has 3/4 cover from ranged attacks originating outside the aura.

**3. Hemorrhage (Channeled Ability)**
- **Action:** 1 Action to initiate and maintain
- **Cost:** 5 BP per turn
- **Range:** 30ft
- **Dice Pool:** Blood (5) + 4 vs. Willpower
- **Effect:** The cyclone targets one creature that is currently **Bleeding**. The target must defend. On a failure, the cyclone takes control of their blood, dealing 15 Necrotic damage and healing the cyclone for the same amount. The cyclone can maintain this channel as its action each turn.

**4. Unnatural Storm (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** The Bloodhail Cyclone is always at the center of a swirling storm that extinguishes non-magical light sources within 60ft. The area is heavily obscured. The cyclone has blindsight up to 60ft.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** A Bloodhail Cyclone is a vile magical phenomenon, created when a powerful weather-controlling ritual is corrupted by blood magic, often through a mass sacrifice. It is a mindless, hungry entity, drawn to sources of life. It scours the landscape, its passing leaving behind a frozen, exsanguinated wasteland. Some ancient Vampire clans were rumored to have created these as mobile siege weapons or territorial defenses.

**Behavior:** The cyclone's behavior is simple: move towards the largest concentration of living creatures and activate its Sanguine Vortex. It will use Flensing Shards on targets at the edge of its aura to inflict the Bleeding status. Once a target is bleeding, it becomes a prime candidate for Hemorrhage, allowing the cyclone to sustain itself. It has no concept of tactics beyond this, but its raw power and defensive capabilities make it a formidable foe.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** This is a battle of attrition and positioning. Staying out of the Sanguine Vortex is paramount. Ranged attackers will need to find a way to get clear shots, either by dispelling the magical storm or by getting dangerously close. Inflicting Fire or Lightning damage is the most effective way to bring it down quickly. It's critical to stop anyone from being Wounded, as this fuels the cyclone's most dangerous ability. Healers must be protected.

**For the GM:** The cyclone is a battlefield controller. Its primary function is to disrupt the party's formation and create a hazardous arena. Use its pull effect to drag weaker characters into the vortex. Remember that it is mindless; it will always target the closest wounded creature with Vitality Drain, which can be used by clever players to bait it. Its non-magical physical immunity means martial characters will need magical weapons or alternative strategies to contribute effectively.

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Corrupted Storm Heart:** A fist-sized chunk of ice that never melts and constantly weeps a thin, red fluid. It radiates both cold and necrotic energy. Can be used to create a weapon that has a chance to inflict the Wounded status, or armor that provides Cold Resistance.
- **Essence of the Vortex:** A swirling, contained wind. Can be used in a ritual to create a minor, temporary weather effect (e.g., fog, rain, light snow).
- **Vampiric Ice Shard:** A single, perfectly preserved shard from the cyclone. Can be crushed to cast a single-target spell that deals Cold damage and grants the caster temporary health equal to the damage dealt.

---

### Scaling Options

- **Threat Value 17 (Deadly):** Increase Health to 150 and Armor to 7. The **Ichorous Vortex** aura is now 30ft. **Vitality Drain** no longer requires the target to be Wounded. Gains a new reaction: **Flash Freeze**. When the cyclone takes Fire damage, it can use its reaction to instantly create a 10ft radius burst of ice around the attacker. The attacker must make an Agility save (DC 16) or become Restrained (frozen in place) until the end of their next turn.
- **Threat Value 20 (Legendary):** As above, but gains Legendary Actions (2 per round). It can use **Flensing Shards** (1 action) or **Move** up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks (1 action). The pull effect of its **Ichorous Vortex** is now a contested Fury vs. Fury check, and on a failure, the target is also knocked prone.

---

## Frost-Wrought Avenger

*A fallen warrior's form, encased in a thick layer of magical frost. It moves with a stiff, relentless gait, its eyes glowing with a cold, blue light. It is not truly unliving, but a vessel animated by a vengeful frost spirit.*

**Threat Value:** 10 (Medium)

**Attributes:**
- **Fury:** 5 (Primary)
- **Soul:** 2
- **Shadow:** 4
- **Will:** 5

**Immunities:** Cold, Fear, Charm
**Vulnerabilities:** Fire
**Resistances:** Slashing and Piercing damage from non-magical weapons.

---

### Attacks & Abilities

**1. Hoarfrost Axe (Basic Attack)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Melee (5ft)
- **Dice Pool:** Fury (5) + 4 vs. Parry/Dodge
- **Damage:** 12 Physical (Slashing) Damage + 4 Cold Damage. On hit, the target's movement speed is halved until the end of their next turn.

**2. Glacial Slam (Area of Effect)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Cost:** 6 SE
- **Range:** 15ft cone
- **Dice Pool:** Fury (5) + 3 vs. Agility
- **Effect:** The avenger slams its weapon into the ground, sending a wave of frost. Creatures in the cone must defend. On a failure, they take 10 Cold damage and are Restrained (frozen in place) for one round. A successful defense results in half damage and no restraint.

**3. Vengeful Pursuit (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** At the start of its creation, a Frost-Wrought Avenger chooses one target it can see. It will relentlessly pursue this target, ignoring all other creatures unless they are directly blocking its path. The avenger has +2 on all attack dice pools against its chosen target. It can only choose a new target if its current one is defeated or has left its sensory range for more than an hour.

**4. Unyielding Ice (Passive)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** The avenger cannot be knocked prone, pushed, or pulled against its will as long as it is standing on solid ground. Its icy form is anchored to the earth.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** These entities are born on battlefields in frozen climes or in places where a great injustice was committed during a harsh winter. A wandering spirit of cold and vengeance finds a suitable vessel—a form with lingering martial prowess—and infests it, encasing it in magical ice. The result is a relentless killing machine, driven by the spirit's singular purpose, which is almost always revenge against a specific person, lineage, or organization.

**Behavior:** The avenger is a slow but unstoppable force. It will identify its quarry (or the creature that most resembles its original target) and march towards them. It uses Glacial Slam if multiple enemies are clustered together or blocking its path to its primary target. Otherwise, it will use Hoarfrost Axe on its chosen victim until they are slain. It is utterly single-minded and will smash through walls, ignore significant damage, and wade through fire to reach its goal.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** The avenger's single-mindedness is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. The chosen target will be under immense pressure, but this allows the rest of the party to act with relative impunity. Use Fire damage to melt its armor and exploit its vulnerability. The target player should focus on defense and evasion (kiting), while their allies deal damage. Spells that can immobilize it, despite its Unyielding Ice, are valuable for buying time.

**For the GM:** Make the avenger's relentless nature terrifying. Describe it walking through a bonfire, ignoring the flames, to continue its pursuit. The challenge for the party is not just defeating it, but protecting the target. If the target goes down, the avenger will immediately move to the next most "guilty" looking party member (e.g., the one who dealt it the most damage).

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Heart of Frozen Vengeance:** A shard of ice that remains at absolute zero. Can be used to craft a weapon that deals extra Cold damage and can slow targets.
- **Unyielding Frostplate:** A piece of the avenger's icy armor. Can be incorporated into existing armor to grant the wearer immunity to being knocked prone.
- **The Avenger's Target:** The reason for the creature's existence could be a major plot hook. Perhaps it was hunting a villain the party is also after, or maybe it believes one of the party members is responsible for its creation.

---

### Scaling Options

- **Threat Value 13 (Major):** Increase Health to 120 and Armor to 8. **Hoarfrost Axe** now deals 15 Physical + 6 Cold damage. The range of **Glacial Slam** increases to a 20ft cone. Gains a new aura: **Rimefrost Aura (5ft)** - creatures starting their turn in the aura take 3 Cold damage and cannot take reactions.
- **Threat Value 17 (Deadly):** As above, but its **Vengeful Pursuit** is now more potent. It can use its reaction to make a **Frostblade Strike** attack against its Intruder if they try to move away from it. It also gains one Legendary Resistance, allowing it to succeed on a saving throw it would have failed.

---

## Frostbound Guardian

*A towering figure of living ice, formed from the frozen essence of ancient glaciers. It moves with deliberate purpose, its crystalline form glowing with an inner cold light. It is a sentinel of the frozen wastes, bound to protect a sacred site or artifact.*

**2. Avalanche Crush (Area of Effect)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Cost:** 6 SE
- **Range:** 15ft cone
- **Dice Pool:** Fury (5) + 3 vs. Agility
- **Effect:** The guardian unleashes a wave of frost and ice. Creatures in the cone must defend. On a failure, they take 10 Cold damage and are Restrained (frozen in place) for one round. A successful defense results in half damage and no restraint.

**3. Guardian's Vigil (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** When combat begins, the Frostbound Guardian designates the nearest creature as its "Intruder." It will relentlessly move towards this target, ignoring all other creatures unless they are directly blocking its path. The guardian has +2 on all attack dice pools against its designated Intruder. It only chooses a new Intruder if its current one is neutralized or has left its sensory range for more than a minute.

**4. Frozen Anchor (Passive)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** The guardian cannot be knocked prone, pushed, or pulled against its will as long as it is standing on solid ground. Its icy form is anchored to the earth.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** Frostbound Guardians are ancient protectors, formed from the primordial ice of Nosgoth's frozen regions. They are created by powerful elemental rituals to safeguard sacred sites, such as hidden temples or powerful artifacts buried in glaciers. They remain dormant, indistinguishable from natural ice formations, until disturbed by intruders.

**Behavior:** The guardian is a slow but unstoppable force. It will identify its Intruder and march towards them. It uses Avalanche Crush if multiple enemies are clustered together or blocking its path to its primary target. Otherwise, it will use Frostblade Strike on its chosen victim until they are neutralized. It will smash through obstacles rather than detour, unless ordered otherwise by its creator or warding geas.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** The guardian's single-mindedness is its greatest weakness. The designated Intruder will be under immense pressure, but this allows the rest of the party to act with relative impunity. Use Fire damage to melt its armor and exploit its vulnerability. The Intruder should focus on defense and evasion (kiting), while their allies deal damage. Spells that can immobilize it, despite its Frozen Anchor, are valuable for buying time.

**For the GM:** Make the guardian's relentless nature the focus of the encounter. Describe it walking through a bonfire, ignoring the flames, to continue its pursuit. The challenge for the party is not just defeating it, but protecting the Intruder. If the Intruder goes down, the guardian will immediately designate the next closest creature as its new Intruder.

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Core of Eternal Frost:** A shard of ice that remains at absolute zero. Can be used to craft a weapon that deals extra Cold damage and can slow targets.
- **Guardian's Ice Shard:** A piece of the guardian's core. Can be incorporated into existing armor to grant the wearer immunity to being knocked prone.
- **Protected Relic:** The guardian was protecting something. Its destruction may reveal a hidden treasure, a dangerous artifact, or a source of great power.

---

### Scaling Options

- **Threat Value 13 (Major):** Increase Health to 120 and Armor to 8. **Frostblade Strike** now deals 15 Physical + 6 Cold damage. The range of **Avalanche Crush** increases to a 20ft cone. Gains a new aura: **Rimefrost Aura (5ft)** - creatures starting their turn in the aura take 3 Cold damage and cannot take reactions.
- **Threat Value 17 (Deadly):** As above, but its **Guardian's Vigil** is now more potent. It can use its reaction to make a **Frostblade Strike** attack against its Intruder if they try to move away from it. It also gains one Legendary Resistance, allowing it to succeed on a saving throw it would have failed.

## Arcane Flare Wyrm

*A serpentine creature of pure magical energy, its body a swirling mass of bright, arcane flames. It darts through the air with unpredictable speed, leaving trails of searing light in its wake. It is a manifestation of uncontrolled spellcasting, given form and fury.*

**1. Arcane Bite (Basic Attack)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Melee (5ft)
- **Dice Pool:** Soul (6) + 4 vs. Dodge
- **Damage:** 8 Fire Damage + 6 Force Damage. On hit, the target is marked with an **Arcane Burn**, taking 2 additional Fire damage from any Fire-based attacks for the next minute.

**2. Flare Burst (Area of Effect)**
- **Action:** 1 Action
- **Cost:** 8 SE
- **Range:** 20ft radius sphere, centered on the Wyrm
- **Dice Pool:** Soul (6) + 3 vs. Agility
- **Effect:** All creatures within the area must defend. On a failed defense, they take 12 Fire damage and are Blinded for one round. On a success, they take half damage and no Blindness.

**3. Spell Echo (Reaction Ability)**
- **Reaction:** When a creature within 30ft casts a spell, the Wyrm can attempt to echo it.
- **Cost:** 10 SE
- **Dice Pool:** Soul (6) + 4 vs. the spellcaster's Soul
- **Effect:** If successful, the Wyrm casts the same spell at the same target, but with half the normal damage or effect. This can only be done once per spell cast.

**4. Volatile Essence (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** When the Arcane Flare Wyrm is reduced to 0 Health, it explodes in a burst of arcane energy. All creatures within 10ft must make an Agility save (DC 15) or take 15 Fire damage. The explosion can ignite flammable objects in the area.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** Arcane Flare Wyrms are born from magical catastrophes—failed rituals, exploding artifacts, or the uncontrolled release of arcane power. They are living embodiments of wild magic, drawn to areas of high magical activity. They are not evil, but chaotic, their actions unpredictable and often destructive.

**Behavior:** The Wyrm is highly mobile and aggressive. It will dart around the battlefield, using its speed to avoid attacks while striking with Arcane Bite. It favors Flare Burst when surrounded, and will attempt to echo spells cast by the party, turning their own magic against them. It is fearless and will fight until destroyed, ending in a spectacular explosion.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** This is a hit-and-run fighter. Use area control to limit its movement, and avoid casting spells if possible, as it can echo them. Cold damage is highly effective, as is anti-magic. The explosion on death is a major threat—position the Wyrm away from the party before finishing it off.

**For the GM:** Emphasize the Wyrm's unpredictability. Have it echo powerful spells to surprise the party. Its explosion can be a trap if the players don't manage the battlefield properly. Pair it with spellcasters to maximize its Spell Echo ability.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** Thundercrack Behemoths are spawned during massive electrical storms, particularly those infused with dark magic or the rage of ancient weather spirits. They are embodiments of nature's fury, roaming the skies or lurking in storm-wracked ruins. They are drawn to sources of metal or electricity, which they consume to grow stronger.

**Behavior:** The Behemoth is a brute force elemental. It will charge into melee, using Thunderclap Fist to scatter enemies. It employs Storm Surge to clear groups or strike at range. Its Electric Aura punishes clustering, and it uses its mobility to reposition. It is relentless, feeding on the chaos of battle.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** Spread out to avoid the Electric Aura. Use earth-based magic or barriers to ground it and limit its movement. Lightning immunity makes it tough, but earthen restraints can contain it. Focus on disrupting its SE to prevent Storm Surge.

**For the GM:** Use the Behemoth's mobility to create dynamic battles. Have it phase through walls to ambush or escape. Its aura forces tactical positioning. In a storm setting, it can summon additional lightning strikes as environmental hazards.

---

- **Tempest Essence:** A swirling vial of storm energy. Can be used to cast a one-time Storm Surge spell or enhance weather-related magic.
- **Behemoth's Core:** The central orb, which can be used to power electrical devices or as a component in summoning rituals.

---

- **Range:** 20ft
- **Dice Pool:** Soul (5) + 3 vs. Willpower

**3. Obscuring Veil (Aura)**
- **Passive**
- **Range:** 20ft radius
- **Effect:** The area is heavily obscured (creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks). Creatures within the aura have their movement speed reduced by 5ft.

**4. Ethereal Shift (Innate Ability)**
- **Passive**
- **Effect:** The Mist Binder can become invisible as a bonus action. It remains invisible until it attacks or uses an ability. While invisible, it can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

---

### Lore & Behavior

**Lore:** Mist Binders are formed from the trapped souls of sorcerers or victims of binding rituals gone wrong. They haunt misty swamps, cursed forests, or the sites of ancient imprisonments. They seek to bind more souls to their form, growing stronger with each capture.

**Behavior:** The Binder is a controller, using its mobility and stealth to isolate targets. It will use Misty Grasp to restrain, then Soul Bind to incapacitate. It avoids direct confrontation, preferring to wear down enemies with its aura and abilities.

---

### Tactics & Strategy

**For Players:** Wind spells or abilities can disperse the mist, revealing the Binder. Bright light or fire can weaken it. Focus on breaking free from restraints quickly, and use area attacks to force it out of stealth.

**For the GM:** Use the Binder's stealth to create tension. Have it bind key party members, forcing the others to rescue them. Its aura can turn the battlefield into a maze of fog.

---

### Loot & Rewards

- **Soul Fragment:** A piece of bound soul energy. Can be used in necromantic rituals or to craft items that grant resistance to soul-based effects.

---

- **Threat Value 16 (Deadly):** As above, but **Obscuring Veil** now also silences sounds within the aura. **Soul Bind** lasts for 2 minutes and requires a DC 18 check to break free.
