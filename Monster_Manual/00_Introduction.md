# Monster Manual - Introduction

**Welcome, Game Master**

This Monster Manual provides stat blocks, tactics, and lore for the creatures that prowl the shattered realm of Nosgoth. From feral ghouls to ancient vampires, from spectral wraiths to Hylden abominations, these entities represent the dangers your players will face.

---

## How to Use This Manual

### Organization

The manual is divided into thematic chapters, each containing creatures appropriate for different encounter types and threat levels:

1. **Undead & Vampiric** - Bloodthirsty creatures of the night
2. **Spectral Entities** - Denizens of the Spectral Realm
3. **Mortals & Cultists** - Human enemies and fanatics
4. **Beasts & Mutants** - Corrupted wildlife and monsters
5. **Constructs & Automatons** - Mechanical and magical servants
6. **Hylden Forces** - The banished race and their creations
7. **Elemental & Arcane** - Magical creatures and bound spirits
8. **Ancient Creatures** - Primordial beings and ruin guardians
9. **Legendary Entities** - Story-bound threats and unique foes

### Threat Tiers

Each creature is categorized by threat level, which corresponds to the Threat Value (TV) system from **GM_Guide Chapter 2: Encounter Design**:

- **Minion (TV 0.25):** Weak enemies, 4 equal one standard character
- **Standard (TV 1):** Equal to one PC of the same level
- **Elite (TV 2):** Powerful opponent, equal to two PCs
- **Boss (TV 4):** Major threat, equal to four PCs
- **Legendary (TV 6+):** Campaign-defining entity

**Calculating Encounter TV:**
- Party TV = Sum of all PC levels
- For Balanced Encounter: Enemy TV should equal Party TV
- For Easy: 50-75% of Party TV
- For Hard: 125-150% of Party TV
- For Deadly: 175%+ of Party TV

*Example: Level 5 party of 4 players has Party TV of 20. A balanced encounter could be 20 Standard enemies (TV 1 each), 10 Elite enemies (TV 2 each), 5 Boss enemies (TV 4 each), or a mix.*

## Reading Stat Blocks

### Standard Format

Each creature entry includes:

**Name & Classification**
- **Type:** Undead, Aberration, Beast, etc.
- **Threat Tier:** Minion, Standard, Elite, Boss, or Legendary
- **Threat Value (TV):** Numeric value for encounter balancing

**Lore & Behavior**
Brief description of the creature's nature, origins, and role in Nosgoth.

**Statistics**
- **HP / Health:** Hit Points (some chapters label this as Health)
- **DV:** Defense Value (calculated as 1 + higher of Shadow or Will)
- **DR / Armor:** Damage Reduction or Armor (some chapters label DR as Armor)
- **Movement:** Speed in feet (divide by 5 for squares)
- **Attributes:** Fury, Soul, Shadow, Will, Focus, Blood
- **Resources:** Soul Energy (SE), Blood Points (BP) when applicable
- **Skills:** Relevant trained skills

Note on defenses: In earlier chapters, attacks often roll against a single DV. In later chapters, some attacks target specific defenses or saves such as Dodge/Parry (Agility vs. melee), Agility (area effects), or Will (mental/spiritual effects). Treat these as targeted defense checks using the indicated attribute instead of DV.

**Attacks & Abilities**
- **Primary Attack:** Name, dice pool, damage, special effects
- **Special Abilities:** Unique powers or traits
- **Reactions:** Available response actions

**Tactics**
How the creature fights and behaves in combat.

**Loot (Optional)**
Treasure, components, or unique items the creature may drop.

## Using Creatures Narratively

### More Than Combat

Creatures in Nosgoth are not just obstacles—they're story elements:

**Environmental Storytelling:**
- What does this creature's presence reveal about the location?
- What happened to create or attract this creature here?
- What does it guard, hunt, or fear?

**Faction Connections:**
- Which faction controls, hunts, or studies this creature?
- Can it be negotiated with, befriended, or turned?
- What political implications come from encountering it?

**Corruption Themes:**
- How does corruption manifest in this creature?
- What was it before corruption took hold?
- Can it be saved, or is it too far gone?

### Memorable Encounters

**Give Creatures Personality:**
- Not all undead are mindless—some remember their past lives
- Beasts have survival instincts and pack dynamics
- Even constructs can have quirks from their programming

**Use the Environment:**
- Spectral creatures phase through walls
- Vampires use darkness and elevation
- Beasts lay traps and ambushes

**Create Consequences:**
- Fleeing enemies return with reinforcements
- Defeated leaders leave power vacuums
- Spared creatures remember mercy (or betrayal)

## Design Philosophy

### Tactical Depth

Creatures are designed to create interesting combat choices:
- **Minions** force area control decisions
- **Standards** test core competencies
- **Elites** require focus fire or crowd control
- **Bosses** demand strategy and resource management
- **Legendaries** are puzzle fights with multiple solutions

### Status Effects

Many creatures inflict status effects tied to damage types (see **Core Mechanics, Chapter 9: Combat**):
- **Bleeding:** Ongoing damage from Piercing/Slashing
- **Burning:** Fire damage over time
- **Stunned:** Lost actions from Bludgeoning/Force
- **Soul Drained:** Reduced max SE from Soul damage
- **Corrupted:** Vulnerability and corruption gain

### Action Economy

Encounter design should consider total actions per side:
- 4 Minions = 4 actions (same as 4-player party)
- 1 Boss = 1 action (needs minions or legendary actions)
- Use Legendary Actions for solo bosses (see individual entries)

## A Note on Lethality

Nosgoth is a dangerous world. Not every encounter should be perfectly balanced. Sometimes players should:
- **Flee from overwhelming threats**
- **Negotiate rather than fight**
- **Use environment and tactics over brute force**
- **Accept that death is a real consequence**

However, ensure players have:
- **Clear warning signs** of deadly encounters
- **Options for escape or alternative solutions**
- **Moments to shine** against appropriate challenges
- **Meaningful victories** that feel earned

*"In Nosgoth, death is not the end—but becoming a monster might be worse."*
