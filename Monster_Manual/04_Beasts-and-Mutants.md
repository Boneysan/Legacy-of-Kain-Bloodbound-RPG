# Chapter 4: Beasts & Mutants

## Understanding Nosgoth's Wildlife

Nosgoth is not a dead world. Despite the collapse of the Pillars, the rise of vampires, and the spreading corruption, **life endures**. But it does not endure unchanged.

The beasts of Nosgoth have adapted to survive in a world of darkness and magic. Some have grown larger, meaner, and more aggressive. Others have been warped by proximity to ley lines, corrupted ruins, or spectral breaches. A few have evolved symbiotic relationships with the very forces that should have destroyed them.

### Why Beasts Matter

**Natural Threats**: Not every encounter needs to be vampires or cultists. Sometimes, the party is attacked by a **Dire Cave Wolf** pack simply because they entered the wolves' territory. Beasts ground the world in naturalism.

**Environmental Hazards**: Beasts serve as guardians of dangerous locations. A **Nosgothian Drake** nesting in a ruin makes exploration perilous. A **Stonemaul Troll** blocking a mountain pass forces the party to find another route—or fight.

**Corruption Indicators**: Mutated beasts signal environmental corruption. If the party encounters **Blight-Boars** with necrotic tusks, they know something is *wrong* with this forest.

**Resource Opportunities**: Beast parts (hides, bones, venom) are valuable trade goods. A **Glimmerback Lizard's** scales can be sold or crafted into armor. A **Warptooth Cougar's** fangs make potent alchemical reagents.

### Common Beast Traits

**Instinct Over Strategy**: Beasts fight with animal cunning, not tactical genius. They use pack tactics, ambush predators, or territorial aggression, but they don't use complex plans.

**Fight or Flight**: Beasts have survival instincts. If injured or outnumbered, they may flee. Predators retreat when prey becomes too dangerous.

**Environmental Adaptation**: Beasts use their natural habitats to advantage. Cave wolves fight in darkness. Drakes nest on high cliffs. Bears use forests for cover.

**Low Corruption Resistance**: Most beasts have poor Will or Soul attributes, making them vulnerable to Corruption and mental effects. This is why so many have been twisted by dark magic.

## Creature Entries

### 1. Dire Cave Wolf

**Type**: Beast (Predator)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 2-6

#### Lore
Wolves in Nosgoth have grown larger and more aggressive over the centuries. Dire Cave Wolves are the alpha predators of the northern mountains and deep forests. They hunt in packs, using coordinated tactics to bring down prey much larger than themselves.

These wolves have adapted to darkness. Their eyes reflect even the faintest light, and they can navigate pitch-black caves with ease. Their howls echo through valleys, striking fear into travelers.

Unlike their mundane cousins, Dire Cave Wolves are intelligent enough to recognize magical threats. They avoid spellcasters when possible and target weaker, isolated prey.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 24
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 1 (all saves)

#### Attacks
**Savage Bite** (Fury 3 + Melee 2 = 5d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 5 Physical damage on success
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Grappled** (the wolf clamps its jaws onto them). While Grappled, the target has Disadvantage on attacks and cannot move. The target can escape with a Fury + Athletics roll vs the wolf's Fury (DR 3).

**Pounce** (Fury 3 + Pack Tactics 3 = 6d6, once per encounter)
- Range: 15 feet (charge attack)
- Damage: 6 Physical damage
- Effect: The wolf charges at a target and leaps. If the attack succeeds, the target is knocked **Prone** (Disadvantage on Defense until they stand, costs half movement).

#### Abilities
**Pack Tactics**: The wolf gains +1 die on attack rolls for each allied wolf within 10 feet (max +3 dice).

**Darkvision**: The wolf can see in complete darkness up to 60 feet.

**Keen Senses**: The wolf has Advantage on Focus + Tracking rolls to detect creatures by scent or sound. They can track prey across miles.

**Coordinated Hunt**: Once per round, when an ally hits a creature the wolf can see, the wolf can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its movement speed toward that creature (without provoking opportunity attacks).

#### Tactics
- **Surround and Strike**: Wolves spread out to flank enemies, using Pack Tactics to maximize dice pools.
- **Target the Weak**: Wolves prioritize wounded, isolated, or low-armor targets. They avoid heavily armored foes.
- **Pounce and Grapple**: Alpha wolves (the strongest in the pack) use Pounce to knock down priority targets, then other wolves Grapple and drag them away.
- **Retreat When Bloodied**: If more than half the pack is killed, the survivors flee. Wolves are smart enough to know when they're outmatched.

#### Loot
- Dire wolf pelt (thick fur, can be crafted into winter clothing or traded) - **Trade Value**: 12 supplies
- Wolf fangs (1d3, used in alchemy or crafting) - **Trade Value**: 5 supplies each

**Type**: Beast (Dragon-kin)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 5-10

#### Lore
Drakes are lesser cousins of true dragons—smaller, less intelligent, but no less dangerous. Nosgothian Drakes are winged reptilian predators that nest in mountain caves and ruined towers. They're fiercely territorial and will attack anything that intrudes on their domain.

Unlike true dragons, Drakes cannot speak or cast spells. However, they possess a limited breath weapon (a gout of flame or toxic gas, depending on subspecies) and scales tough enough to deflect arrows.

Drakes are solitary hunters, but mated pairs will defend their nests to the death. Their eggs are highly valuable to alchemists and collectors.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 45
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (Physical saves), 1 (Mental saves)

- Range: 30-foot cone
- Damage: 7 Fire damage to all creatures in the cone
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 2 Shadow save or be **Burning** (2 Fire damage per turn for 3 turns).

#### Abilities
**Flight**: The Drake can fly, ignoring ground-based obstacles and terrain. While flying, melee attackers have Disadvantage unless they can reach the Drake.

**Armored Scales**: The Drake has Armor 3 vs Physical damage and Armor 1 vs Elemental damage. Attacks with the "Armor Piercing" property ignore this.

**Territorial Roar**: Once per encounter, the Drake can roar intimidatingly. All enemies within 30 feet must pass a DR 2 Will save or be **Frightened** (Disadvantage on attacks, cannot willingly move closer to the Drake) for 2 rounds.

**Dive Attack**: If the Drake starts its turn flying at least 20 feet above its target, it can dive. It moves up to its full flying speed in a straight line toward the target and makes a Bite attack with +2 dice. If the attack hits, the target is knocked **Prone**.

#### Tactics
- **Aerial Superiority**: The Drake starts combat flying, using Flame Breath to soften up groups before diving to melee.
- **Dive and Retreat**: It uses Dive Attack to strike priority targets (casters, ranged attackers), then flies back up to avoid retaliation.
- **Breath Weapon Management**: The Drake saves Flame Breath for clustered enemies or when it recharges during combat.
- **Territorial Roar for Control**: If surrounded, the Drake roars to Frighten enemies and create space to fly away.

### 3. Glimmerback Lizard

**Type**: Beast (Reptile)  
**Threat Tier**: Minion (TV 0.25)  
**Recommended Levels**: 1-3

#### Lore
Glimmerback Lizards are small, skittish reptiles that inhabit forests and swamps. They're named for the iridescent scales on their backs, which shimmer with faint magical energy. These scales are prized by armorers and enchanters.

Despite their fragility, Glimmerbacks have a defensive mechanism: when threatened, they release a blinding flash of light from their scales and sprint away. They're more valuable alive than dead, making them targets for trappers and traders.

#### Stats

#### Abilities
**Shimmer Flash** (1/encounter): As a reaction when attacked, the Glimmerback releases a burst of light. The attacker must pass a DR 2 Focus save or be **Blinded** (Disadvantage on attacks and Defense) until the end of their next turn. The Glimmerback then immediately moves up to its full movement speed away (no opportunity attacks).

**Camouflage**: While motionless, the Glimmerback has Advantage on Stealth rolls. In forests or swamps, they're nearly invisible.

**Skittish**: The Glimmerback automatically flees if it takes any damage. It will not fight unless physically restrained.

#### Tactics
- **Avoid Combat**: Glimmerbacks don't fight. They use Shimmer Flash to blind attackers and sprint away.
- **Swarm Encounters**: GMs can place 4-8 Glimmerbacks in an area. If players want their scales, they must capture them alive (traps, nets, non-lethal damage).

#### Loot
- Glimmerback scales (1d3 if killed, 1d6 if captured alive) - **Trade Value**: 10 supplies each, used in crafting enchanted light armor or shields

### 4. Blight-Boar

**Type**: Beast (Corrupted Boar)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 3-7

#### Lore
Blight-Boars were once ordinary wild boars. Exposure to necrom antic runoff from corrupted ruins has mutated them into diseased monstrosities. Their tusks drip with necrotic energy, and their flesh is covered in festering sores.

These creatures are aggressive and territorial, attacking anything that enters their domain. They're common in corrupted forests, blighted swamps, and areas near Hylden ruins.

Consuming Blight-Boar meat causes illness in mortals. Even vampires find their blood tainted and foul.

**Unstoppable Charge**: When the Boar uses Trampling Charge, it cannot be stopped by opportunity attacks or terrain (it smashes through obstacles).

**Diseased Flesh**: If a creature consumes Blight-Boar meat, they must pass a DR 3 Blood save or become violently ill (Disadvantage on all rolls for 8 hours).

#### Tactics

**Type**: Beast (Vampiric Hound)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 4-8

#### Lore
Bloodgullet Hounds are twisted canines created—or evolved—to serve vampires. They resemble large mastiffs, but their eyes glow red, and their fangs are unnaturally long. They drink blood like their masters and are often used as hunting beasts by vampire clans.

Some vampires gift Bloodgullet Hounds to favored thralls as guards. Others release packs of them into the wilderness to terrorize mortal settlements.

Unlike normal dogs, Bloodgullets are viciously intelligent. They can track prey across vast distances, recognize spellcasters by scent, and coordinate ambushes.

**Type**: Beast (Giant Humanoid)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 6-11

#### Lore
Stonemaul Trolls are massive, brutish creatures that dwell in caves and mountain passes. They're not particularly intelligent, but they don't need to be—their size, strength, and regeneration make them formidable threats.

Trolls are solitary and territorial. They claim sections of mountains or forests as their own and attack anything that intrudes. They're opportunistic eaters, consuming anything from deer to travelers to adventurers.

Despite their fearsome reputation, Trolls can be bargained with if approached cautiously. They understand simple language and will sometimes allow passage in exchange for food or shiny objects.

- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4 (large target, slow)
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Physical saves, tough), 1 (Mental saves, dumb)

**Size: Large**: The Troll occupies a 2x2 tile space. It has 10-foot reach on melee attacks. Creatures can move through its space but treat it as difficult terrain.

**Thick Hide**: The Troll has Armor 3 vs Physical damage and Armor 1 vs Elemental damage.

Bramblehide Bears are massive ursines that have fused with the corrupted forests they inhabit. Thorny vines and brambles grow from their fur, creating a natural armor of barbs. Their claws are as hard as iron, and their bite can crush bone.

These bears are fiercely territorial and will defend their dens to the death. They're common in corrupted woodlands and blighted groves, where the natural order has been twisted by dark magic.

### 8. Warptooth Cougar

**Type**: Beast (Phase Predator)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 7-12

#### Lore
Warptooth Cougars are spectral predators that exist partially in both the Material and Spectral Realms. They were ordinary mountain lions once, but exposure to reality breaches has altered them. Now they can phase in and out of existence, making them nearly impossible to track or kill.

These cougars are solitary hunters, stalking prey across vast territories. They're intelligent enough to recognize dangerous opponents and will avoid fights they can't win. However, when they do attack, they're relentless.

Their most unsettling trait is their ability to seemingly vanish mid-combat, only to reappear behind their prey seconds later.

- Range: 30 feet (teleport attack)
- Damage: 8 Physical + 3 Soul damage
- Effect: The Cougar phases out of existence, then reappears adjacent to a target and attacks. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. On hit, the target is knocked **Prone**.

#### Abilities
**Phase Shift**: As a bonus action, the Cougar can become **Incorporeal** (immune to Physical damage, can move through walls and creatures) until the start of its next turn. It cannot attack while Incorporeal, but it can move freely. This ability can be used once per turn.

**Spectral Ambush**: While Incorporeal or Hidden, the Cougar's next attack has Advantage.

**Vanish**: As a reaction when the Cougar takes damage, it can Phase Shift immediately (even if it's already used Phase Shift this turn). This can be used once per encounter.

**Keen Senses**: The Cougar can see invisible creatures and has Advantage on Focus + Tracking rolls.

#### Tactics
- **Phase Shift for Positioning**: The Cougar phases into walls or through enemies to reach vulnerable targets (casters, ranged attackers).

## Combat Tactics & Encounter Design

### Using Beasts Effectively

**Environmental Integration**: Beasts are tied to their environments. Wolves ambush in forests. Drakes nest on cliffs. Bears guard dens. Use terrain to the beasts' advantage.

**Pack Dynamics**: Many beasts hunt in groups. A single Dire Cave Wolf is manageable. A pack of 6 is deadly. Use Pack Tactics abilities to reward clustering.

**Retreat and Regroup**: Unlike undead or constructs, beasts are *alive*. They have survival instincts. If the fight turns, they flee. This creates opportunities for tracking, traps, or negotiations.

**Resource Value**: Beast parts (hides, fangs, venom) are valuable. Players who kill a Nosgothian Drake gain scales worth 90+ supplies. This encourages hunting expeditions and crafting.

### Sample Encounters

#### Encounter 1: Wolf Pack Ambush (Levels 2-4)
**Setup**: The party travels through a forest at night. 5 **Dire Cave Wolves** (Standard, TV 1 each, TV 5 total) ambush them.

**Tactics**: Wolves start Hidden (DR 2 Focus + Perception to detect). They attack from multiple directions, using Pack Tactics to overwhelm isolated PCs. The Alpha (use scaling option) focuses on the weakest target.

**Environmental Factor**: The forest is dark. PCs without Darkvision have Disadvantage on attacks. The wolves have Darkvision and full mobility.

**Twist**: If players spare the Alpha, it retreats and avoids the party's path in the future. If they kill all wolves, the forest becomes safer but they lose potential resources (pelts, fangs).

#### Encounter 2: Drake's Lair (Levels 5-7)
**Setup**: A **Nosgothian Drake** (Elite, TV 2) nests in a ruined tower. The party needs to enter the tower to retrieve an artifact. The Drake will not negotiate—it's protecting eggs.

**Tactics**: The Drake starts flying, using Flame Breath on intruders. It uses Dive Attack to pick off ranged attackers, then flies back up. If the party enters the nest chamber, the Drake fights to the death.

**Environmental Factor**: The tower has multiple floors and open windows. The Drake can fly in and out freely. PCs must either force it to land (grounding spells, traps) or fight it in the air (difficult without flight).

**Twist**: Inside the nest are 2 Drake eggs. Players can take them (worth 100+ supplies each) or leave them. Taking the eggs may attract revenge from the Drake's mate (future encounter).

---

#### Encounter 3: Troll Bridge (Levels 6-8)
**Setup**: A **Stonemaul Troll** (Elite, TV 2) has claimed a mountain pass. The party needs to cross. The Troll demands payment: "Food or shiny things!"

**Tactics**: If the party refuses to pay, the Troll attacks with Ground Slam, then follows up with Massive Club. If they negotiate, the Troll accepts 20+ supplies worth of food/treasure and lets them pass.

**Environmental Factor**: The pass is narrow. The Troll's size blocks the path. Players can try to sneak past (DR 3 Shadow + Stealth), climb around (DR 3 Fury + Athletics), or fight.

**Twist**: If the party befriends the Troll (gives extra food, makes it laugh), it warns them about a vampire ambush further up the pass.

---

#### Encounter 4: Corrupted Forest (Levels 5-8)
**Setup**: The party enters a blighted forest. They're attacked by 2 **Blight-Boars** (Standard, TV 1 each) and 1 **Bramblehide Bear** (Elite, TV 2). Total TV: 4.

**Tactics**: Blight-Boars charge first with Trampling Charge, spreading out to use Corruption Aura. The Bear ambushes from the trees (Forest Camouflage), using Bramble Charge to scatter the party. The Bear then Grapples priority targets with Crushing Bite.

**Environmental Factor**: The forest itself is corrupted. At the start of each round, all PCs must pass a DR 1 Will save or take 1 Corruption (corrupted atmosphere). Staying in the forest too long is dangerous.

**Twist**: After combat, the party finds the source of corruption: a Hylden artifact buried beneath the forest. They can destroy it (ending the corruption but alerting nearby Hylden agents) or leave it (corruption spreads, but they avoid attention).

## Integrating Beasts into Your Campaign

### Ecosystem and Balance
Beasts are part of Nosgoth's ecosystem. Their presence or absence tells stories:
- **Abundant wildlife** = area is safe from vampires and corruption
- **Corrupted beasts only** = area is blighted, natural life is dying
- **No beasts at all** = something has driven them away (worse threat nearby)

### Hunting and Resources
Encourage players to hunt beasts for resources:
- **Drake scales** → craft armor
- **Wolf pelts** → trade for supplies
- **Troll hide** → heavy armor
- **Glimmerback scales** → enchanted items

Hunting creates side quests, supports the barter economy, and rewards creative tactics (traps, non-lethal captures).

### Corruption and Mutation
Use beasts to show the spread of Corruption:
- **Early campaign**: Natural beasts (wolves, bears, deer)
- **Mid campaign**: Corrupted beasts (Blight-Boars, Bramblehides)
- **Late campaign**: Fully mutated horrors (abominations, hybrids)

This progression visually demonstrates the world's decay.

### Taming and Companions
Some players may want to tame beasts:
- **Glimmerback Lizards**: Easily domesticated, used as light sources
- **Dire Cave Wolves**: Difficult but possible with training (Fury + Animal Handling, DR 4)
- **Bloodgullet Hounds**: Loyal if blood-bonded (requires vampiric character)

Tamed beasts provide unique abilities but require feeding and care.

## Story Hooks

### The Great Hunt
A noble offers 100 supplies to the party if they slay an **Elder Drake** terrorizing nearby farms. The Drake is protecting eggs—does the party kill it, or negotiate?

### The Corrupted Grove
A druid begs the party to cleanse a forest corrupted by Hylden magic. Inside, **Blight-Boars** and **Bramblehide Bears** guard the corruption source. Cleansing it attracts Hylden attention.

### The Troll's Toll
A **Stonemaul Troll** blocks the only pass through the mountains. The party can pay, fight, or trick it. If they befriend it, the Troll becomes a recurring ally (or enemy, if betrayed).

### The Phantom Predator
Villagers report livestock disappearing. Tracks vanish mid-path. The culprit: a **Warptooth Cougar**. The party must track and kill the phase predator before it turns on humans.

### The Glimmerback Expedition
A merchant hires the party to capture **Glimmerback Lizards** alive (scales are valuable). They must navigate a swamp, avoid predators, and use non-lethal tactics to trap the lizards.

## GM Guidance: Running Beast Encounters

### Make Them Feel Alive
Beasts aren't mindless. They have personalities, instincts, and survival drives. A wolf pack flees when outmatched. A Troll negotiates. A Bear defends cubs to the death.

### Use Environmental Storytelling
Beast encounters reveal information:
- **Dead wolves with necrotic wounds** = vampires nearby
- **Drake nest in ruins** = this area was once important
- **Corrupted boars in a forest** = Hylden artifact nearby

### Reward Creativity
Players who use traps, bait, terrain, or non-lethal tactics should succeed:
- **Lure wolves away with meat** instead of fighting
- **Negotiate with Troll** instead of killing
- **Trap Glimmerbacks with nets** instead of slaughtering

### Balance Lethality and Story
Beasts should feel dangerous but not unfair. A Dire Cave Wolf should threaten a level 2 party but not TPK them. Adjust HP, damage, or numbers if needed.

### Connect to Larger Plot
Beasts aren't just random encounters:
- **Corrupted beasts** point to Hylden activity
- **Drake nests** may hold ancient relics
- **Troll territories** may block paths to important locations
