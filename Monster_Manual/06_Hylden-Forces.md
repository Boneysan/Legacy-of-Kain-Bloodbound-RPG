# Chapter 6: Hylden Forces

## Understanding the Banished Race

The **Hylden** are not mere monsters—they are an ancient civilization, banished beyond the veil of reality for crimes against the natural order. They were once equals to the Ancients (the progenitors of vampires), but when denied dominion over the Pillars of Nosgoth, they waged war. Their last act before banishment was to curse the Ancients with vampirism, ensuring eternal suffering for their enemies.

Now, the Hylden exist in a dimension of torment, constantly seeking ways to break through and reclaim the world they believe is rightfully theirs. They possess mortals, build biomechanical abominations, and corrupt everything they touch.

### Why Hylden Matter

**Cosmic Horror**: The Hylden represent existential dread. They are alien minds in twisted flesh, beings who view reality itself as malleable. Encountering them should feel *wrong*—like the world is breaking.

**Technological Terror**: The Hylden blend magic and technology in ways no other faction can. Their constructs are biomechanical nightmares, their weapons defy natural law, and their architecture warps perception.

**Moral Complexity**: The Hylden were wronged. They were denied their place in the world and cursed for eternity. Some may genuinely believe they're liberators, not conquerors. This moral ambiguity makes them compelling antagonists.

**Campaign Threats**: Hylden are endgame villains. They possess the power to collapse the barriers between dimensions, unleash plagues of possession, and reshape entire regions. Fighting them should feel apocalyptic.

### Common Hylden Traits

**Possession**: Many Hylden manifest by possessing mortal hosts. The original personality is suppressed or destroyed, and the body is twisted to suit Hylden needs.

**Biomechanical Fusion**: Hylden technology blends flesh and metal. Their constructs are part organic, part machine—alive and suffering.

**Reality Distortion**: Hylden presence warps reality. Gravity weakens, colors shift, sounds echo strangely. Being near them feels fundamentally *wrong*.

**Corruption Aura**: Hylden radiate Corruption. Prolonged exposure causes physical and mental deterioration.

**Immunity to Spectral Manipulation**: The Hylden are immune to spectral effects. The Spectral Realm cannot touch them—they exist outside its rules.

## Creature Entries

### 1. Hylden Shock Trooper

**Type**: Hylden (Possessed Warrior)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 6-11

#### Lore
Shock Troopers are Hylden warriors possessing the bodies of strong mortals (typically soldiers or mercenaries). The possession process twists the host's body, enhancing strength and durability at the cost of humanity. Shock Troopers serve as frontline soldiers in Hylden invasions.

They're recognizable by their unnatural movements—joints bending at wrong angles, heads tilting too far, mouths opening impossibly wide. Their eyes glow with sickly green light, and their voices echo as if speaking from a great distance.

Shock Troopers are disciplined and tactical. Unlike mindless undead or feral beasts, they use cover, coordinate flanking maneuvers, and adapt to enemy tactics. This makes them far more dangerous than their stats suggest.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 50
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Physical and Will saves), 2 (other saves)
- **Movement**: 7 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Medium (bio-tempered flesh, DR 2 vs Physical, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 3
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 4
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Military Tactics: 4
- Hylden Combat Arts: 3
- Possession Control: 3

#### Attacks
**Corrupted Blade** (Fury 4 + Hylden Combat Arts 3 = 7d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical + 2 Corruption damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target gains 1 Corruption point automatically (the blade is infused with Hylden essence).

**Biometal Rifle** (Focus 3 + Ranged Combat 3 = 6d6, costs 1 SE)
- Range: 50 feet
- Damage: 5 Force damage
- Effect: This weapon fires concentrated energy bolts. On hit, the target must pass a DR 2 Will save or be **Disrupted** (lose 1 SE or BP, or take 1 additional Soul damage if they have neither).

**Hylden Surge** (Soul 3 + Possession Control 3 = 6d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 20-foot cone
- Damage: 5 Corruption damage to all creatures in the cone
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 3 Will save or gain 1 Corruption point. The Shock Trooper releases a wave of Hylden energy from its possessed body.

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control (already possessed). Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (takes +2 damage, the light harms the possessing entity).

**Bio-Tempered Flesh**: The host's body has been enhanced by Hylden biomancy. It has DR 2 vs Physical damage and does not need to eat or sleep (the Hylden sustains it).

**Tactical Coordination**: When within 20 feet of another Hylden creature, the Shock Trooper gains +1 die on attack rolls (Hylden share tactical data telepathically).

**Soul Override** (1/encounter): When reduced to 0 HP, the Hylden can attempt to possess a nearby mortal (within 10 feet). Target must pass a DR 4 Will save or be possessed. The Shock Trooper's HP becomes half the new host's max HP, and combat continues. If no valid host is nearby, the Hylden dissipates (death).

**Reality Distortion Aura** (Passive): Enemies within 10 feet of the Shock Trooper suffer -1 die on Will saves (reality feels unstable).

#### Tactics
- **Coordinated Assault**: Shock Troopers work in squads, using Tactical Coordination to boost attack rolls. They focus fire on one target at a time.
- **Biometal Rifle at Range**: They start combat at range, using rifles to Disrupt spellcasters and drain resources.
- **Corrupted Blade in Melee**: When enemies close, they switch to blades, using Corruption damage to wear down defenses over time.
- **Hylden Surge for Corruption**: They use this ability when enemies cluster, spreading Corruption to multiple targets.
- **Soul Override Escape**: When defeated, they attempt to possess the nearest PC or NPC, creating chaos. Players must stay alert even after "killing" them.

#### Loot
- Corrupted blade (weapon, deals +2 Corruption damage but wielder gains 1 Corruption per day of use) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies, dangerous to use
- Biometal rifle (ranged weapon, uses SE as ammo, deals Force damage) - **Trade Value**: 50 supplies, requires study to use safely
- Hylden possession shard (small crystal, contains fragment of Hylden essence) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies, used in anti-possession wards or studied for lore
- Twisted host body (if studied, reveals Hylden biomancy techniques) - **Trade Value**: Priceless for scholars

#### Scaling Options
**Hylden Warlord** (Boss, TV 4): +30 HP, increase Fury and Tactics to 5. Add "Command Protocol" ability (once per turn, grant all allied Hylden within 30 feet Advantage on next attack). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Attack, or Hylden Surge.

---

### 2. Hylden Flesh Architect

**Type**: Hylden (Biomancer)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 8-13

#### Lore
Flesh Architects are Hylden scientists and sorcerers who specialize in biomancy—the art of reshaping living tissue. They create the horrors that serve Hylden armies: Iron-Cage Beasts, bio-constructs, and possessed warriors.

Flesh Architects possess frail hosts (scholars, mages, or the elderly), as they rely on intellect over physical prowess. Their bodies are covered in surgical scars, grafted flesh, and implanted bio-metal nodes that pulse with sickly light.

They view flesh as clay to be molded. To them, pain and suffering are irrelevant—only results matter. They're utterly amoral, conducting experiments on prisoners and creating abominations without remorse.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 38
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 4 (Will and Soul saves), 2 (Physical saves)
- **Movement**: 5 tiles per turn (frail host)
- **Armor**: Light (grafted bio-plates, DR 1 vs Physical, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 5
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 5
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 1

**Skills**:
- Biomancy: 5
- Forbidden Surgery: 4
- Hylden Rituals: 4

#### Attacks
**Fleshwarp Touch** (Soul 5 + Biomancy 5 = 10d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Soul + 3 Corruption damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target's flesh begins to mutate. They are **Weakened** (Disadvantage on Fury-based rolls) for 3 rounds as their muscles spasm uncontrollably.

**Bio-Spike Eruption** (Soul 5 + Biomancy 5 = 10d6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 30 feet (target creature or corpse)
- Damage: 8 Physical damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target
- Effect: The Architect causes bone spikes to erupt from the target's body, impaling nearby creatures. If the target is a corpse, it's consumed in the process (cannot be revived).

**Summon Abomination** (Soul 5 + Hylden Rituals 4 = 9d6, once per encounter, costs 5 SE)
- Range: 20 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Architect animates a corpse or reshapes nearby flesh into a **Flesh Abomination** (Minion, TV 0.5, 15 HP, deals 4 damage per attack, lasts until destroyed). The Abomination obeys the Architect's commands.

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control. Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Biomancy Mastery**: The Architect can manipulate living and dead tissue. Outside combat, they can perform surgeries, create bio-constructs, or enhance allies with grafts (requires 1 hour per procedure).

**Regeneration Protocol**: At the start of each of the Architect's turns, they regain 5 HP by cannibalizing their host's tissues. This causes the host visible deterioration (skin peeling, organs shifting).

**Flesh Harvest** (Reaction): When a creature within 20 feet dies, the Architect can absorb its vitality as a reaction, regaining 10 HP.

**Reality Distortion Aura** (Passive): Enemies within 10 feet suffer -1 die on Will saves.

#### Tactics
- **Stay at Range**: Flesh Architects avoid melee, staying behind Shock Troopers or Abominations while casting.
- **Summon Abomination Early**: They open combat by raising an Abomination to soak damage and provide cover.
- **Fleshwarp Touch for Defense**: If forced into melee, they use Fleshwarp Touch to Weaken attackers, then retreat.
- **Bio-Spike Eruption for Area Damage**: They target corpses or heavily armored enemies, using Bio-Spike to damage clustered foes.
- **Flesh Harvest for Sustain**: They position near dying enemies to trigger Flesh Harvest, regaining HP constantly.
- **Regeneration Protocol**: Combined with Flesh Harvest, Architects are hard to kill without burst damage.

#### Loot
- Bio-surgery tools (allows biomancy procedures, requires training) - **Trade Value**: 60 supplies, dangerous in wrong hands
- Flesh graft samples (1d3, can be implanted to grant +1 to an attribute for 24 hours, causes 1 Corruption) - **Trade Value**: 25 supplies each
- Hylden biomancy tome (contains forbidden knowledge) - **Trade Value**: 80 supplies, studying it grants Biomancy skill but causes Corruption
- Grafted organs (if harvested from the Architect's body) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies, used in alchemy or rituals

#### Scaling Options
**Master Flesh Architect** (Boss, TV 4): +20 HP, increase Soul and Biomancy to 6. Add "Mass Fleshwarp" ability (affects all creatures within 20 feet, DR 5 Will save or be Weakened). Can summon 2 Abominations per encounter. Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Fleshwarp Touch, or Flesh Harvest.

---

### 3. Mind-Tethered Abomination

**Type**: Hylden Bio-Construct  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 5-9

#### Lore
Mind-Tethered Abominations are grotesque creations—multiple corpses fused together by Hylden biomancy and linked to a controlling intelligence (usually a Flesh Architect or Hylden Warlock). They serve as shock troops and terror weapons.

Each Abomination is unique, depending on the materials used. Some have four arms, others have heads sprouting from their torsos, and a few crawl on tendrils of fused limbs. All are nightmarish to behold.

They're not truly alive—they're animated by Hylden psychic will. Severing the mental tether (killing the controller) causes them to collapse instantly.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 35
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 3
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (Physical saves), 0 (Mental saves, mindless)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn (lurching gait)
- **Armor**: Medium (fused flesh, DR 2 vs Physical)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 0 (no soul, construct)
- Shadow: 2
- Will: 0 (controlled remotely)
- Focus: 1
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Brawling: 3
- Relentless Assault: 2

#### Attacks
**Fused Limbs** (Fury 4 + Brawling 3 = 7d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical damage
- Effect: The Abomination can make two Fused Limbs attacks per turn (multiple arms or tendrils).

**Corrosive Bile** (Fury 4 + Spew 2 = 6d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 15-foot cone
- Damage: 5 Acid damage to all creatures in the cone
- Effect: Affected creatures' armor DR is reduced by 1 for 3 rounds (corrosive effect).

#### Abilities
**Bio-Construct**: Immune to fear, charm, poison, disease, and mental effects (no mind of its own). Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe.

**Mind-Tethered**: The Abomination is controlled by a Hylden creature within 100 feet. If the controller is killed or the tether is severed (DR 4 Soul + Rituals check to sever psychically), the Abomination collapses instantly (death).

**Regeneration (Fused Flesh)**: The Abomination regains 3 HP at the start of each of its turns (flesh knits together). This regeneration stops if it takes Fire or Acid damage since its last turn.

**Unnatural Resilience**: The Abomination ignores the first instance of being reduced to 0 HP each encounter (it just keeps moving, horror movie style). It collapses on the second instance.

**Terror Presence**: Creatures seeing the Abomination for the first time must pass a DR 2 Will save or be **Shaken** (Disadvantage on next attack) due to its horrific appearance.

#### Tactics
- **Relentless Advance**: Abominations charge forward, attacking the nearest enemy with Fused Limbs.
- **Corrosive Bile When Available**: They use this when multiple enemies are in range, reducing armor effectiveness.
- **Regeneration Reliance**: They rely on regeneration to outlast enemies. Players must use Fire or Acid to stop healing.
- **Unnatural Resilience Shock**: Players often think they've killed it, only for it to keep attacking. This creates horror and tension.
- **Distraction Role**: Abominations are meant to soak damage while Flesh Architects or Shock Troopers attack from range.

#### Loot
- Fused flesh samples (1d3 chunks, useful for biomancy research) - **Trade Value**: 10 supplies each
- Bio-metal nodes (implanted in the Abomination's body) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies, can be studied or repurposed

#### Scaling Options
**Greater Abomination** (Elite, TV 2): +20 HP, increase Fury to 5. Add "Grappling Tendrils" ability (Grapple attack, restrains target). Regeneration increases to 5 HP per turn.

### 4. Corruption Host

**Type**: Hylden (Corrupted Mortal)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 4-8

#### Lore
Corruption Hosts are mortals who have been exposed to Hylden essence for too long. They're not fully possessed—instead, their bodies and minds are slowly being rewritten by Corruption. They're in the transition phase, still partially human but increasingly monstrous.

Corruption Hosts serve as scouts, spies, and infiltrators for Hylden forces. They can pass as normal mortals (if covered up), but their true nature reveals itself in combat: skin splits to reveal writhing tendrils, eyes glow with Hylden light, and their voices echo with alien whispers.

Many Corruption Hosts don't realize what's happening to them. They believe they're being "enlightened" or "evolved." This makes them tragic figures—victims who've become monsters.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 28
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 4
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (all saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: None (civilian clothing), but see Abilities

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 3
- Shadow: 4
- Will: 3
- Focus: 2
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Deception: 3
- Corruption Manifestation: 3
- Infiltration: 4

#### Attacks
**Corrupted Touch** (Soul 3 + Corruption Manifestation 3 = 6d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 4 Soul + 2 Corruption damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target gains 1 Corruption point (Hylden essence spreads).

**Tendril Lash** (Fury 3 + Corruption Manifestation 3 = 6d6, once per turn)
- Range: 15 feet (tendrils burst from the Host's body)
- Damage: 5 Physical damage
- Effect: Target must pass a DR 2 Shadow save or be **Grappled** (held by tendrils). While Grappled, the target takes 2 Corruption damage per turn automatically. Escape requires a DR 3 Fury + Athletics roll.

**Corruption Wave** (Soul 3 + Corruption 3 = 6d6, Recharge 6, costs 2 SE)
- Range: 20-foot radius centered on the Host
- Damage: 4 Corruption damage to all creatures in the radius
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 3 Will save or be **Confused** (Disadvantage on all rolls for 2 rounds, as Hylden whispers fill their minds).

#### Abilities
**Partial Possession**: The Host is between mortal and Hylden. They're immune to Corruption effects (already saturated) but vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Corrupted Flesh**: When the Host takes damage, tendrils and growths erupt from their wounds defensively. They gain +1 DV for each time they've been hit this encounter (max +3 DV), as their body becomes increasingly monstrous.

**Infiltrator's Guise**: Outside combat, the Host appears mostly human (pale, sickly, but human). They can pass Deception checks to blend into mortal populations. This allows them to gather intelligence or set up ambushes.

**Hylden Whispers** (Passive): Enemies within 10 feet of the Host hear faint whispers in an alien language. They suffer -1 die on Focus-based rolls (concentration is disrupted).

**Final Transformation** (1/encounter): When reduced to 0 HP, the Host can choose to fully embrace the Corruption. They immediately transform into a **Mind-Tethered Abomination** (Standard, TV 1, as described above) and continue fighting. This is a one-way transformation—they cannot revert.

#### Tactics
- **Infiltrate First**: Corruption Hosts use Infiltrator's Guise to approach unsuspecting PCs or set up ambushes. They strike when targets are vulnerable (resting, distracted, separated).
- **Tendril Lash for Control**: They Grapple priority targets (casters, ranged attackers), dealing Corruption damage over time.
- **Corrupted Touch in Melee**: They spread Corruption to as many enemies as possible, weakening them for future encounters.
- **Corruption Wave When Surrounded**: If clustered enemies close in, they use Corruption Wave to Confuse everyone, creating chaos.
- **Final Transformation as Last Resort**: When dying, they transform into an Abomination, shocking players and continuing the fight.

#### Loot
- Corrupted mortal belongings (mundane items, but tainted) - **Trade Value**: 1-3 supplies
- Corruption shard (crystallized Hylden essence extracted from the body) - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies, used in anti-Corruption wards or research
- Hylden whisper recording (if studied, reveals Hylden communication patterns) - **Trade Value**: 25 supplies (lore)

#### Scaling Options
**Advanced Corruption Host** (Elite, TV 2): +15 HP, increase Soul and Corruption Manifestation to 4. Corrupted Flesh increases DV by +2 per hit (max +6). Add "Spread Corruption" ability (all enemies within 10 feet gain 1 Corruption at the start of the Host's turn).

---

### 5. Bio-Sigil Reaver

**Type**: Hylden (Assassin)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 9-14

#### Lore
Bio-Sigil Reavers are elite Hylden assassins who possess athletic hosts (warriors, acrobats, or hunters) and enhance them with bio-sigils—living tattoos that grant supernatural abilities. These sigils pulse and shift across their skin, glowing with eerie light.

Reavers are silent killers, using stealth and precision to eliminate high-value targets. They can phase through walls, turn invisible, and strike from impossible angles. Encountering one means someone wants you dead—badly.

They're utterly dedicated to their mission. If capture is imminent, they self-destruct, destroying their host body and all evidence of their presence.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 48
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 7
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 4 (Shadow and Will saves), 3 (Physical saves)
- **Movement**: 9 tiles per turn (enhanced agility)
- **Armor**: Light (bio-enhanced skin, DR 2 vs Physical, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 4
- Shadow: 5
- Will: 4
- Focus: 5
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:

- Bio-Sigil Manipulation: 4
- Stealth: 5

#### Attacks
**Sigil Blade** (Shadow 5 + Assassination 5 = 10d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 8 Physical + 3 Corruption damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Bleeding** (3 Physical damage per turn) and gains 1 Corruption point. The blade is wreathed in shifting sigils.

**Phase Strike** (Shadow 5 + Bio-Sigil Manipulation 4 = 9d6, costs 2 SE)
- Range: 30 feet (teleport attack)
- Damage: 10 Physical + 3 Corruption damage
- Effect: The Reaver phases through reality, appearing adjacent to the target and striking. This movement ignores walls, obstacles, and enemies. It does not provoke opportunity attacks.

**Corruption Burst** (Soul 4 + Bio-Sigil Manipulation 4 = 8d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 20-foot radius centered on the Reaver
- Damage: 6 Corruption damage to all creatures in the radius
- Effect: The Reaver's sigils flare violently. All affected creatures gain 1 Corruption point.

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control. Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Bio-Sigil Camouflage**: As a bonus action, the Reaver can activate their sigils to become **Invisible** (cannot be seen, attacks against them have Disadvantage). This lasts until they attack or take damage. They can use this ability once per turn.

**Phase Movement**: The Reaver can move through walls and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain (costs double movement). This represents brief dimensional shifts.

**Master Assassin**: The Reaver has Advantage on attack rolls vs creatures that have not acted yet this encounter (surprise advantage). Additionally, attacks made while Invisible automatically have Advantage.

**Self-Destruct Protocol** (1/encounter): When reduced to 0 HP, the Reaver can choose to detonate their bio-sigils. All creatures within 15 feet take 12 Corruption damage (DR 4 Shadow save to halve) and gain 1 Corruption point. The Reaver's body is completely destroyed (no resurrection, no loot).

#### Tactics
- **Open with Invisibility**: Reavers start combat Invisible, using Bio-Sigil Camouflage to close unseen.
- **Phase Strike for Assassination**: They use Phase Strike to appear behind casters or ranged attackers, dealing massive damage before anyone can react.
- **Sigil Blade When Visible**: If forced into extended melee, they use Sigil Blade's Bleeding and Corruption to wear down targets.
- **Phase Movement for Repositioning**: They phase through walls to escape, reposition, or reach targets in cover.
- **Corruption Burst When Surrounded**: If cornered, they use Corruption Burst to damage and Corrupt everyone nearby.
- **Self-Destruct as Final Option**: If capture is certain, they detonate, taking enemies with them and destroying evidence.

#### Loot
- Sigil blade (weapon, deals +3 Corruption damage but wielder gains 1 Corruption per day of use) - **Trade Value**: 50 supplies, dangerous
- Bio-sigil fragments (if the Reaver didn't self-destruct, 1d3 fragments remain) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies each, can be studied or used in rituals
- Phase crystal (allows one-time teleport up to 30 feet) - **Trade Value**: 60 supplies
- **Note**: If the Reaver self-destructs, no loot remains (body is vaporized).

#### Scaling Options
**Master Bio-Sigil Reaver** (Boss, TV 4): +30 HP, increase Shadow and Assassination to 6. Add "Multi-Phase Strike" ability (use Phase Strike twice in one turn against different targets). Add 3 Legendary Actions per round: Move (phasing), Attack, or Corruption Burst (costs 2 actions).

### 6. Hylden Rift Engineer

**Type**: Hylden (Reality Manipulator)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 10-15

#### Lore
Rift Engineers are Hylden specialists who manipulate dimensional barriers. They create portals, summon reinforcements from the Hylden dimension, and destabilize reality itself. They're the reason Hylden invasions are so devastating—they can open gates anywhere, bypassing conventional defenses.

Rift Engineers possess scholarly hosts (mages, priests, or researchers) and enhance them with dimensional anchors—bio-metal implants that allow reality manipulation. Their presence causes localized reality distortions: gravity fluctuates, time skips, and colors invert.

They're strategic thinkers, not frontline fighters. They open rifts to bring in reinforcements, retreat when threatened, and reshape battlefields to favor Hylden forces.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 40
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 5 (Will and Soul saves), 3 (Physical saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Medium (dimensional anchors, DR 2 vs Physical, DR 3 vs Magic, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 6
- Shadow: 4
- Will: 5
- Focus: 5
- Blood: 1

**Skills**:
- Dimensional Manipulation: 5
- Hylden Portal Magic: 5
- Reality Distortion: 4

#### Attacks
**Reality Tear** (Soul 6 + Dimensional Manipulation 5 = 11d6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: 8 Force + 3 Soul damage
- Effect: The Engineer tears a hole in reality, damaging the target. On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Unraveled** (lose 3 SE or BP, or take 3 additional Soul damage).

**Rift Collapse** (Soul 6 + Hylden Portal Magic 5 = 11d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 5 SE)
- Range: 30-foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet
- Damage: 10 Force damage to all creatures in the radius
- Effect: The Engineer creates a dimensional rift that immediately collapses. All creatures in the radius must pass a DR 4 Shadow save or be pulled 15 feet toward the center and knocked **Prone** (gravitational distortion).

**Dimensional Bolt** (Soul 6 + Reality Distortion 4 = 10d6, costs 2 SE)
- Range: 50 feet
- Damage: 6 Force damage
- Effect: Basic ranged attack. The Engineer uses this when conserving SE or targeting distant enemies.

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control. Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Open Rift** (1/encounter, requires 1 action, costs 5 SE): The Engineer opens a portal to the Hylden dimension. Roll 1d3:
- **1**: 2 **Hylden Shock Troopers** (Elite, TV 2 each) emerge.
- **2**: 1 **Mind-Tethered Abomination** (Standard, TV 1) and 3 **Corruption Hosts** (Standard, TV 1 each) emerge.
- **3**: 1 **Flesh Architect** (Elite, TV 2) emerges.
The summoned creatures obey the Engineer and last until destroyed. The rift closes after summoning.

**Dimensional Anchor**: The Engineer can teleport up to 30 feet as a bonus action by creating a micro-rift. This does not provoke opportunity attacks. They can use this once per turn.

**Reality Distortion Field** (Passive): The area within 20 feet of the Engineer is unstable. All creatures (including allies) in this area have Disadvantage on saves vs dimensional or teleportation effects. The field also causes minor visual distortions (colors shift, shapes warp).

**Emergency Rift** (Reaction, 1/encounter): When reduced below 10 HP, the Engineer can open a rift and escape into the Hylden dimension as a reaction. They vanish instantly, ending their participation in the encounter. They may return later (GM's discretion).

#### Tactics
- **Open Rift Early**: Engineers start combat by summoning reinforcements, using Open Rift to bring in Shock Troopers or Abominations.
- **Reality Tear at Range**: They stay at range, using Reality Tear to Unravel spellcasters and drain resources.
- **Rift Collapse for Control**: They use this to cluster enemies, pull them into melee with summoned creatures, and knock them Prone.
- **Dimensional Anchor for Mobility**: They teleport constantly, staying out of melee range and repositioning behind cover.
- **Reality Distortion Field for Protection**: They rely on the field to protect them from teleportation-based attacks (Phase Strike, Blink, etc.).
- **Emergency Rift When Dying**: If the party is winning, they escape, ensuring they'll return as a recurring villain.

#### Loot
- Dimensional anchor (bio-metal implant, allows one-time 30-foot teleport) - **Trade Value**: 70 supplies
- Rift stabilizer (device, can be used to close Hylden rifts or create temporary portals) - **Trade Value**: 100 supplies, requires study to use
- Hylden portal equations (written on host's skin, contains dimensional magic formulas) - **Trade Value**: 80 supplies (lore), studying grants portal magic knowledge
- **Note**: If the Engineer uses Emergency Rift, they take the most valuable loot with them (GM determines what's left).

#### Scaling Options
**Master Rift Engineer** (Boss, TV 4): +25 HP, increase Soul and Portal Magic to 7. Can use Open Rift twice per encounter (summon two waves of reinforcements). Add "Dimensional Storm" ability (60-foot radius, 12 Force damage, Recharge 4-6). Add 3 Legendary Actions per round: Teleport, Reality Tear, or Open Rift (costs 3 actions).

### 7. Void-Spoken Oracle

**Type**: Hylden (Prophet)  
**Threat Tier**: Boss (TV 4)  
**Recommended Levels**: 12-17

#### Lore
Void-Spoken Oracles are Hylden priests who channel the will of the Hylden collective consciousness. They speak prophecies, coordinate invasions, and serve as living conduits for dimensional energies. Their presence signifies a major Hylden operation.

Oracles possess powerful hosts (sorcerers, high priests, or royalty) and transform them into living beacons. Their bodies emit constant reality distortions, their voices echo with thousands of Hylden whispers, and their eyes glow with otherworldly light.

They're commanders, not soldiers. They direct Hylden forces with telepathic coordination, buff allies, and debilitate enemies. Fighting an Oracle means fighting an entire Hylden army's intelligence and will.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 100
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 6
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 5 (all saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn (floats above ground)
- **Armor**: Heavy (reality shell, DR 3 vs Physical, DR 5 vs Magic, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 7
- Shadow: 4
- Will: 7
- Focus: 6
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Prophecy: 6
- Hylden Coordination: 6
- Void Channeling: 6

#### Attacks
**Void Blast** (Soul 7 + Void Channeling 6 = 13d6, costs 4 SE)
- Range: 60 feet
- Damage: 12 Corruption + 6 Soul damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Unraveled** (lose 4 SE or BP, or take 4 additional Soul damage) and gains 2 Corruption points.

**Prophecy of Doom** (Soul 7 + Prophecy 6 = 13d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 6 SE)
- Range: All enemies within 60 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Oracle speaks a prophecy. All affected enemies must pass a DR 5 Will save or be **Cursed** (Disadvantage on all rolls for 3 rounds, as they're haunted by visions of their doom).

**Dimensional Rupture** (Soul 7 + Void Channeling 6 = 13d6, once per encounter, costs 8 SE)
- Range: 40-foot radius centered on a point within 80 feet
- Damage: 14 Force + 6 Corruption damage to all creatures in the radius
- Effect: The Oracle rips reality open. All creatures in the radius gain 2 Corruption points and must pass a DR 5 Shadow save or be teleported 2d6 x 5 feet in a random direction (lose positioning, potentially separated from allies).

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control. Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Void Channeling**: The Oracle constantly channels Hylden energy. At the start of each of their turns, they regain 3 SE (max SE: 20).

**Telepathic Coordination**: All Hylden allies within 100 feet of the Oracle gain +2 dice on all rolls (the Oracle coordinates their actions telepathically). If the Oracle is killed, all Hylden allies lose this bonus and must pass a DR 4 Will save or be **Stunned** for 1 round (psychic backlash).

**Reality Shell**: The Oracle is surrounded by a shell of warped reality. They have DR 3 vs Physical and DR 5 vs Magic. Additionally, ranged attacks against the Oracle have Disadvantage (projectiles curve around them).

**Prophecy Sight**: The Oracle can see 3 rounds into the future. They have Advantage on all Defense rolls (they see attacks coming before they happen).

**Legendary Actions (3 per round)**: The Oracle can use Legendary Actions at the end of another creature's turn.
- **Move**: The Oracle floats up to half their movement speed.
- **Void Blast**: The Oracle uses Void Blast (costs 1 action).
- **Buff Allies**: The Oracle grants one Hylden ally within 60 feet +4 dice on their next roll (costs 2 actions).
- **Prophecy of Doom** (costs 3 actions): The Oracle uses Prophecy of Doom (even if it hasn't recharged).

#### Tactics
- **Telepathic Coordination Always Active**: The Oracle's presence makes all Hylden forces +2 dice stronger. This is their most dangerous ability.
- **Dimensional Rupture Opening**: They open combat with Dimensional Rupture, scattering the party and corrupting everyone.
- **Prophecy of Doom for Control**: They use this to Curse the entire party, making every action harder.
- **Void Blast for Damage**: They spam Void Blast using Legendary Actions, targeting spellcasters to drain SE.
- **Buff Allies with Legendary Actions**: They use actions to buff the strongest Hylden ally (Shock Trooper Warlord, Flesh Architect, etc.), turning them into unstoppable threats.
- **Prophecy Sight for Defense**: They're extremely hard to hit due to Advantage on Defense. Players must use status effects, area attacks, or creative tactics.
- **Void Channeling for Sustain**: They regenerate SE constantly, allowing near-endless casting.

### 8. Hylden Horror Warden

**Type**: Hylden (Jailer/Torturer)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 11-16

#### Lore
Horror Wardens are Hylden torturers who specialize in psychological warfare. They possess hosts with strong wills (prison wardens, inquisitors, or military officers) and use them to break spirits and harvest suffering.

Wardens don't just kill—they terrorize. They prolong fights, inflict fear, and trap victims in psychic prisons. Their goal is to shatter morale and create trauma that lasts long after the encounter ends.

They're often found guarding Hylden installations, prisons, or ritual sites. Encountering one means someone is being held captive nearby—and whatever the Hylden are doing to them is worse than death.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 55
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 4 (Will saves), 3 (other saves)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Heavy (tormentor's plate, DR 3 vs Physical, immune to Spectral damage)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 5
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 5
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 2

**Skills**:
- Torture Techniques: 5
- Psychological Warfare: 5
- Hylden Imprisonment: 4

#### Attacks
**Barbed Chain** (Fury 4 + Torture Techniques 5 = 9d6)
- Range: 15 feet
- Damage: 7 Physical damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Grappled** (held by barbed chains). While Grappled, the target takes 3 automatic Physical damage per turn and has Disadvantage on all rolls (pain).

**Mind Spike** (Soul 5 + Psychological Warfare 5 = 10d6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: 8 Soul damage
- Effect: The Warden drives a psychic spike into the target's mind. Target must pass a DR 4 Will save or be **Frightened** (Disadvantage on attacks, cannot willingly move closer to the Warden) for 3 rounds.

**Cage of Despair** (Soul 5 + Hylden Imprisonment 4 = 9d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 5 SE)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Warden traps one target in a psychic cage. Target must pass a DR 4 Will save or be **Paralyzed** (cannot move or act) for 2 rounds. While Paralyzed, they experience vivid hallucinations of their worst fears. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of their turns to break free.

#### Abilities
**Hylden Nature**: Immune to Spectral effects, possession, and mind control. Resistant to Soul damage (half damage). Vulnerable to Radiant damage (+2 damage).

**Fear Aura** (Passive): All enemies within 20 feet of the Warden have Disadvantage on Will saves (oppressive dread).

**Harvest Suffering**: When a creature within 30 feet takes damage (from any source), the Warden regains 2 HP (they feed on pain). This can only trigger once per turn.

**Break the Mind** (Passive): When the Warden reduces a creature to 0 HP, that creature must pass a DR 5 Will save or gain 2 Corruption points (trauma from the encounter).

**Psychic Prison**: If the Warden successfully uses Cage of Despair on a creature, that creature is marked. For the next 24 hours, they have nightmares of the encounter (Disadvantage on rest recovery rolls, regain half HP/SE/BP from rest instead of full).

#### Tactics
- **Open with Mind Spike**: Wardens start by Frightening priority targets (fighters, leaders), reducing their effectiveness.
- **Barbed Chain for Control**: They Grapple the biggest threat, dealing constant damage while torturing them.
- **Cage of Despair for Neutralization**: They Paralyze dangerous enemies (casters, assassins), trapping them in fear while dealing with others.
- **Fear Aura Positioning**: They position to maximize Fear Aura coverage, making all Will saves harder.
- **Harvest Suffering for Sustain**: They prolong fights, letting allies damage enemies so they can heal from Harvest Suffering.
- **Break the Mind for Long-Term Impact**: Even if the party wins, survivors carry Corruption and nightmares, creating lasting consequences.

#### Loot
- Barbed chain (weapon, 15-foot reach, deals +2 damage when Grappling) - **Trade Value**: 45 supplies
- Tormentor's plate (Heavy armor, DR 3 Physical, grants +1 die on Intimidation) - **Trade Value**: 60 supplies
- Psychic prison shard (can trap one creature's consciousness, one-time use) - **Trade Value**: 70 supplies, dangerous item
- Suffering essence (crystallized pain, harvested by the Warden) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies, used in dark rituals or alchemy

#### Scaling Options
**Master Horror Warden** (Boss, TV 4): +30 HP, increase Soul and Psychological Warfare to 6. Add "Mass Fear" ability (all enemies within 40 feet must pass DR 5 Will save or be Frightened). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Barbed Chain, or Mind Spike.

## Combat Tactics & Encounter Design

### Using Hylden Effectively

**Cosmic Horror Atmosphere**: Hylden encounters should feel *wrong*. Describe reality distortions, alien whispers, and body horror transformations. Use lighting changes, sound effects (if playing digitally), and visceral descriptions.

**Coordinated Assaults**: Hylden forces work together better than any other faction. Shock Troopers provide frontline, Flesh Architects buff and summon, Rift Engineers bring reinforcements, and Oracles coordinate everything. Use their synergies to create challenging encounters.

**Corruption as Threat**: Hylden spread Corruption through damage, auras, and abilities. Even if the party wins, they may leave more Corrupted than before. This creates long-term consequences.

**Moral Ambiguity**: Some Hylden believe they're the rightful rulers of Nosgoth (and they have a point—they were unjustly banished). Use Corruption Hosts and possessed mortals to create moral dilemmas. Are you killing monsters, or murdering victims?

### Sample Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Possession (Levels 6-8)
**Setup**: A village has been infiltrated by 4 **Corruption Hosts** (Standard, TV 1 each, TV 4 total). They're spreading Corruption and preparing for a Hylden invasion. The party must identify and eliminate them before the village is lost.

**Tactics**: Hosts use Infiltrator's Guise to blend in. Players must use Investigation, Perception, or magical detection to identify them. When discovered, Hosts fight with Tendril Lash and Corrupted Touch, spreading Corruption. If killed, some may use Final Transformation, turning into Abominations mid-combat.

**Twist**: One "Host" is actually an innocent villager who's been magically marked to look corrupted (false positive). Killing them is murder. Can the party tell the difference?

---

#### Encounter 2: The Bio-Lab (Levels 9-11)
**Setup**: A **Flesh Architect** (Elite, TV 2) has set up a laboratory in an abandoned tower. It's creating **Mind-Tethered Abominations** (Standard, TV 1 each, 3 present) using captured prisoners. The party must stop it before more victims are transformed.

**Tactics**: The Architect stays at range, using Summon Abomination early. It's protected by 3 existing Abominations that serve as frontline tanks. The Architect uses Bio-Spike Eruption on corpses (prisoners or fallen Abominations), creating area damage. It harvests vitality from dying creatures (Flesh Harvest), regaining HP constantly.

**Environmental Factor**: The lab has caged prisoners. If the party breaks them out, the Architect may target them with Bio-Spike, turning them into weapons. Saving them requires tactical positioning.

**Twist**: One prisoner is a Corruption Host in disguise. If freed, they attack the party from behind at a critical moment.

---

#### Encounter 3: The Rift Assault (Levels 12-14)
**Setup**: A **Hylden Rift Engineer** (Elite, TV 2) is opening a major portal to bring through a Hylden army. The party has 5 rounds to stop them before reinforcements arrive. The Engineer is protected by 2 **Hylden Shock Troopers** (Elite, TV 2 each, TV 4 total). Total TV: 6.

**Tactics**: The Engineer uses Open Rift immediately, summoning reinforcements (GM determines what appears). Shock Troopers form a defensive line, using Tactical Coordination and Hylden Surge to protect the Engineer. The Engineer uses Reality Tear and Rift Collapse to disrupt the party, teleporting with Dimensional Anchor to stay out of reach.

**Time Pressure**: Each round, the rift grows larger. After 5 rounds, a massive Hylden force emerges (the party must retreat or face overwhelming numbers).

**Twist**: If the party damages the rift itself (attacking the portal with Radiant or Force damage, DR 5), they can destabilize it. This causes a dimensional backlash, dealing 10 Force damage to everyone (including the Engineer) and closing the rift early.

---

#### Encounter 4: The Oracle's Army (Levels 15-17)
**Setup**: A **Void-Spoken Oracle** (Boss, TV 4) leads an invasion force: 2 **Bio-Sigil Reavers** (Elite, TV 2 each), 1 **Horror Warden** (Elite, TV 2), and 4 **Shock Troopers** (Elite, TV 2 each). Total TV: 16 (deadly encounter for a level 15 party of 4).

**Tactics**: The Oracle coordinates the entire force with Telepathic Coordination (+2 dice to all allies). It opens with Dimensional Rupture to scatter the party and corrupt everyone. Reavers use Phase Strike to assassinate casters. The Warden uses Cage of Despair to neutralize the party's strongest fighter. Shock Troopers form a shield wall, protecting the Oracle. The Oracle spams Void Blast and Prophecy of Doom using Legendary Actions, debuffing everyone and draining resources.

**Environmental Factor**: The battle takes place in a Hylden temple. Reality is unstable—at the start of each round, roll 1d6:
- **1**: Gravity reverses (all creatures fall upward, take falling damage on ceiling)
- **2-5**: Normal
- **6**: Time skips (everyone loses their next turn except the Oracle)

**Twist**: If the party kills the Oracle, all other Hylden take psychic backlash (Stunned for 1 round). However, the temple begins collapsing (reality destabilizes without the Oracle's control). The party has 3 rounds to escape before it implodes.

## Integrating Hylden into Your Campaign

### Hylden as Campaign Villains
Hylden work best as long-term threats:
- **Early Campaign**: Corruption Hosts and minor Shock Troopers hint at Hylden presence
- **Mid Campaign**: Flesh Architects and Rift Engineers establish Hylden bases
- **Late Campaign**: Void-Spoken Oracles lead full invasions

Use Hylden to escalate stakes. Each encounter reveals more about their plans, building toward a climactic confrontation.

### Hylden Factions
Not all Hylden agree on tactics:
- **The Conquerors**: Want to enslave Nosgoth (led by Oracles and Warlords)
- **The Returners**: Want to reclaim their ancestral home peacefully (maybe)
- **The Vengeful**: Want to destroy the vampires who cursed them (extremists)

Players may ally with one faction against another, creating complex political dynamics.

### Hylden Artifacts
Hylden leave behind dangerous technology:
- **Bio-Metal Implants**: Grant powers but cause Corruption
- **Rift Stabilizers**: Allow teleportation but risk dimensional breaches
- **Possession Shards**: Can trap souls or possess enemies

These artifacts tempt players with power at a cost, fitting the game's themes.

### Moral Questions
Hylden encounters force moral dilemmas:
- **Possessed Mortals**: Are they victims or monsters? Killing them saves others but murders the host.
- **Hylden Justification**: The Hylden were unjustly banished. Do they have a right to return?
- **Corruption Spread**: Fighting Hylden causes Corruption. Is victory worth becoming like them?

---

## Story Hooks

### The Sleeper Agent
A party member begins having strange dreams. They're a **Corruption Host** and don't know it yet. The Hylden are using them to spy on the party. When will the transformation complete? Can they be saved?

### The Rift Breach
A **Rift Engineer** has opened a permanent portal in a major city. Hylden forces pour through. The party must either close the rift (requires destroying the Engineer and performing a ritual) or evacuate the city before it's overrun.

### The Flesh Cathedral
A **Flesh Architect** has turned an entire village into a biomechanical cathedral. The buildings are alive, the streets pulse with veins, and the villagers have been fused into the structure. The party must navigate this nightmare and kill the Architect before the transformation is complete.

### The Oracle's Prophecy
A **Void-Spoken Oracle** approaches the party with a prophecy: "You will bring about the end of Nosgoth." Is this true? Can fate be changed? The Oracle offers to help them "fulfill their destiny"—but can they trust it?

### The Warden's Prison
The party is captured by a **Horror Warden** and imprisoned in a Hylden facility. They must escape while resisting psychological torture, avoid being transformed into Abominations, and free other prisoners—including a powerful ally (or dangerous enemy).

## GM Guidance: Running Hylden Encounters

### Emphasize Wrongness
Hylden should never feel normal. Describe:
- "The air tastes metallic. Your teeth ache."
- "Its joints bend backward. You shouldn't be able to look at it without feeling sick."
- "You hear whispers in a language that hurts to comprehend."

This creates atmosphere and sets Hylden apart from other threats.

### Use Corruption Mechanically
Track Corruption gained during Hylden encounters. After combat, remind players of their Corruption levels. This reinforces the long-term cost of fighting Hylden.

### Coordinate Tactics
Hylden are the smartest enemies in the game. They use terrain, focus fire, protect casters, and retreat when losing. Don't play them as mindless monsters.

### Create Setpieces
Hylden encounters work best as setpieces:
- Collapsing temples
- Reality-warping arenas
- Timed objectives (close the rift before reinforcements arrive)
- Environmental hazards (gravity shifts, time skips, corruption zones)

These make encounters memorable and mechanically distinct.

### Long-Term Consequences
Even winning against Hylden has costs:
- Corruption spreads
- Possessed allies may turn traitor
- Hylden artifacts tempt with power
- Survivors carry trauma (Break the Mind, Psychic Prison)

Show that fighting Hylden is never clean or easy.

**End of Chapter 6: Hylden Forces**

*"They were cast out for a reason. They are not meant to exist in our reality. Their very presence is an affront to the natural order. And yet... were they not wronged? Is their desire to return so different from our own quest for redemption?"*  
— Raziel, Soul Reaver 2
