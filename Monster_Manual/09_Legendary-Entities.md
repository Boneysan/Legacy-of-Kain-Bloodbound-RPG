# Chapter 9: Legendary Entities

*These are names whispered in histories and warnings—entities whose existence bends stories and regions around them.*

## Introduction

Legendary Entities are not mere encounters. They are arcs unto themselves—beings tied to the Pillars, to world-scale rites, to oaths that still echo. They possess lair actions, regional effects, and narrative hooks that can redefine campaigns. Defeating or bargaining with one changes the map of your story.

Guidance:
- Provide foreshadowing and rumors before confrontation.
- Use lair/regional effects to shape the battlefield and stakes.
- Failure should create interesting consequences, not dead ends.
