# Chapter 8: Ancient Creatures & Ruinspawn

*Where the oldest powers of Nosgoth stir—colossi, oracles, and things that should have remained buried.*

## Introduction

The Ancient Creatures of Nosgoth predate empires and faiths. Some are remnants of titans that once walked the land, others are echoes bound to the Pillars, and some are living ruins—predatory mechanisms grown from stone, memory, and fate. They are not merely monsters but historical forces; their presence reshapes regions, their passing leaves new geography.

Expect unusual defenses, lair effects, and battlefield-scale abilities. These beings reward research, ritual preparation, and clever positioning. Many are tied to specific sites—defeating them can alter the world.
