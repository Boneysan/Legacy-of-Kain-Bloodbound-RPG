# Chapter 5: Constructs & Automatons

## Understanding Artificial Threats

In a world where magic and technology intertwine, **constructs** represent the intersection of arcane power and engineering. These are not natural creatures—they are *built*, *bound*, and *programmed* to serve specific purposes.

Some were created by the Sarafan Order to fight vampires with tireless efficiency. Others were forged by ancient civilizations to guard sacred sites. A few are Hylden abominations—biomechanical horrors that blur the line between machine and flesh.

### Why Constructs Matter

**Predictable but Deadly**: Constructs follow programming. They execute orders with perfect precision. This makes them predictable but also relentless—they don't tire, don't feel fear, and don't negotiate.

**Environmental Guardians**: Constructs are ideal guardians for ruins, vaults, and forbidden areas. They activate when intruders enter, attacking until destroyed or their parameters are met.

**Moral Simplicity**: Unlike mortals or beasts, destroying a construct carries no moral weight. They're not alive in any meaningful sense (though some may debate this). This makes them useful for combat-focused encounters without narrative guilt.

**Technological Threats**: Constructs represent the power of lost civilizations. Encountering them hints at ancient secrets, forgotten knowledge, and dangers best left buried.

### Common Construct Traits

**No Biological Needs**: Constructs don't eat, sleep, breathe, or age. They can wait in dormancy for centuries and activate instantly.

**Immunity to Mental Effects**: Most constructs are immune to fear, charm, corruption, and other mind-affecting abilities. They have no minds to manipulate.

**Vulnerability to Specific Damage**: Constructs often have weaknesses—lightning disrupts their magical cores, acid corrodes their frames, or specific keywords shut them down.

**Repair vs Healing**: Constructs cannot be healed by normal means. They require repair (Focus + Engineering or Arcane Lore rolls) or magical restoration.

**Logic-Based Behavior**: Constructs follow rules. Clever players can exploit loopholes in their programming ("You cannot harm guests of the Master" → "We are guests!").

## Creature Entries

### 1. Sarafan Clockwork Knight

**Type**: Construct (Mechanical Warrior)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 5-10

#### Lore
The Sarafan Order created Clockwork Knights as tireless vampire hunters. These mechanical warriors are encased in blessed armor and powered by holy glyphs etched into their frames. They patrol Sarafan strongholds, ruins, and holy sites, attacking vampires and undead on sight.

Clockwork Knights are built to fight in formation, using coordinated tactics and shield walls. They're equipped with silver-edged weapons and blessed ammunition, making them particularly dangerous to supernatural foes.

Their core weakness is their rigid programming. They cannot adapt to unexpected tactics and will follow orders to their destruction. Additionally, their glyph-powered cores can be disrupted by anti-magic effects or overloaded by lightning.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 50
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 6
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (Physical saves), 0 (Mental saves, immune)
- **Movement**: 5 tiles per turn (heavy and mechanical)
- **Armor**: Heavy (blessed plate, Armor 4 vs Physical, Armor 2 vs Soul/Necrotic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 0 (no soul, construct)
- Shadow: 1
- Will: 0 (no will, immune to mental effects)
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:

- Glyph Recognition: 2

#### Attacks
**Silver Longsword** (Fury 4 + Swordplay 4 = 8d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 7 Physical damage, 9 damage vs undead/vampires
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), inflict **Branded** (target glows with holy light, cannot Hide or turn Invisible, lasts 1 hour).

**Shield Bash** (Fury 4 + Formation Combat 3 = 7d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 5 Physical damage
- Effect: Target must pass a DR 3 Fury save or be knocked **Prone**. The Clockwork Knight can use this as a bonus action if it didn't move this turn.

**Crossbow Volley** (Focus 3 + Ranged Combat 2 = 5d6, once per turn)
- Range: 40 feet
- Damage: 5 Physical damage, 7 damage vs undead
- Effect: Silvered bolts. If multiple Clockwork Knights coordinate, they can all fire at the same target with Advantage (GM determines if they're programmed for this).

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means (requires repair with Focus + Engineering, DR 3, restores 10 HP).

**Glyph-Powered Core**: The Knight is powered by holy glyphs. It has Advantage on saves vs Necrotic and Corruption damage. However, if hit by Lightning damage, it must pass a DR 3 Focus save or be **Stunned** for 1 round (overload).

**Holy Ward**: Undead and vampires within 10 feet of the Knight have Disadvantage on attack rolls (holy aura).

**Formation Protocol**: When within 10 feet of another Clockwork Knight, both gain +1 die on Defense rolls (shield wall tactics).

**Anti-Vampire Directive**: The Knight can identify vampires on sight and prioritizes them as targets. It will ignore non-vampires unless they attack it or block its path to a vampire.

#### Tactics
- **Formation Fighting**: Clockwork Knights work in pairs or squads, using Formation Protocol to boost defenses.
- **Priority Targeting**: They identify and attack vampires first, using Silver Longsword to exploit weaknesses.
- **Shield Wall**: If outnumbered, they form a defensive line, using Shield Bash to keep enemies at bay while crossbowmen fire from behind.
- **Holy Ward Pressure**: They advance into melee to apply Holy Ward penalties, making it harder for undead to fight back.
- **No Retreat**: Knights fight until destroyed. They never flee.

#### Loot
- Blessed plate armor (Heavy, Armor 4 vs Physical, Armor 2 vs Soul) - **Trade Value**: 60 supplies
- Silver longsword (+2 damage vs undead) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies
- Glyph core (damaged, but can be studied or sold) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies, can be used in rituals or engineering
- Silvered crossbow bolts (1d6 bolts) - **Trade Value**: 12 supplies

#### Scaling Options
**Veteran Clockwork Knight** (Boss, TV 4): +30 HP, increase Fury and Swordplay to 5. Add "Command Protocol" ability (once per turn, the Knight can order all allied constructs within 30 feet to make a free Shield Bash or Move action). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Attack, or Shield Wall (grant all allies within 10 feet +2 DV until start of next turn).

### 2. Pillar-Guardian Sentinel

**Type**: Construct (Ancient Guardian)  
**Threat Tier**: Boss (TV 4)  
**Recommended Levels**: 10-15

#### Lore
Before the Pillars collapsed, they were guarded by massive stone constructs known as Sentinels. These towering automatons were carved from the same stone as the Pillars themselves and imbued with protective magic by the Circle of Nine.

Sentinels stand dormant for centuries, appearing as statues or architectural features. When intruders approach the Pillars or their associated sites, the Sentinels awaken. They are nearly indestructible, capable of repairing themselves from ambient magical energy, and utterly devoted to their ancient purpose.

Each Sentinel is unique, bearing glyphs and designs specific to the Pillar it guards. Some wield massive stone weapons. Others reshape their bodies mid-combat, growing new limbs or armor plates.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 120
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 4 (Physical saves), 3 (Magical saves), 0 (Mental, immune)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn (slow but unstoppable)
- **Armor**: Massive (stone body, Armor 5 vs Physical, Armor 3 vs Elemental, Armor 1 vs Magic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 6
- Soul: 4
- Shadow: 1
- Will: 0 (no will, immune to mental effects)
- Focus: 4
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Guardian Combat: 5

#### Attacks
**Colossal Fist** (Fury 6 + Guardian Combat 5 = 11d6)
- Range: Melee (15-foot reach due to size)
- Damage: 12 Physical damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), target is knocked back 20 feet and takes an additional 4 damage upon landing (impact).

**Pillar Beam** (Soul 4 + Pillar Magic 4 = 8d6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 60-foot line
- Damage: 10 Soul damage to all creatures in the line
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 4 Will save or be **Stunned** for 1 round (overwhelmed by Pillar energy).

**Stone Spike Eruption** (Fury 6 + Stone Shaping 3 = 9d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 30-foot radius centered on the Sentinel
- Damage: 8 Physical damage to all creatures in range
- Effect: The ground erupts with stone spikes. Affected area becomes difficult terrain (costs double movement) for 3 rounds.

**Ground Slam** (Fury 6 + Guardian Combat 5 = 11d6, once per turn as a bonus action if the Sentinel didn't move)
- Range: 20-foot radius centered on the Sentinel
- Damage: 6 Physical damage
- Effect: All creatures in range must pass a DR 4 Fury save or be knocked **Prone**.

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means.

**Regeneration (Ambient Magic)**: The Sentinel regains 10 HP at the start of each of its turns, unless it's in an area with no magical energy (rare). This regeneration can only be stopped by destroying its core (see below).

**Massive Size**: The Sentinel occupies a 3x3 tile space. It has 15-foot reach on melee attacks. Creatures can move through its space but treat it as difficult terrain.

**Stone Armor**: The Sentinel has Armor 5 vs Physical, Armor 3 vs Elemental, and Armor 1 vs Magic. Attacks with the "Armor Piercing" property reduce these by 2.

**Guardian Protocol**: The Sentinel will not attack creatures who are not threatening the Pillar site or attempting to steal artifacts. Clever players can negotiate or withdraw to avoid combat. However, once combat begins, the Sentinel fights until destroyed or intruders flee the area.

**Core Weakness**: Hidden within the Sentinel's chest is a magical core (DV 8, 30 HP). If a player can specifically target the core (requires a called shot with Disadvantage and DR 4), they can damage it directly. If the core is destroyed, the Sentinel collapses (instant death).

**Legendary Actions (3 per round)**: The Sentinel can use Legendary Actions at the end of another creature's turn. It has 3 Legendary Actions per round.
- **Move**: The Sentinel moves up to half its movement speed.
- **Colossal Fist**: The Sentinel makes one Colossal Fist attack.
- **Stone Shaping** (costs 2 actions): The Sentinel reshapes the battlefield. It can create a 10-foot-tall stone wall (blocks movement and line of sight) or collapse an existing wall within 30 feet.
- **Pillar Beam** (costs 3 actions): The Sentinel uses Pillar Beam (even if it already used it this round).

#### Tactics
- **Pillar Beam Opening**: The Sentinel starts combat with Pillar Beam to soften up clustered enemies and Stun priority targets (casters, leaders).
- **Stone Spike Eruption for Control**: It uses this ability to create difficult terrain, slowing enemy movement and splitting the party.
- **Colossal Fist for Damage**: It focuses Colossal Fist attacks on heavily armored or high-HP targets, using its massive damage to wear them down.
- **Ground Slam for Crowd Control**: If surrounded, it uses Ground Slam to knock everyone Prone, then retreats or reshapes terrain with Legendary Actions.
- **Regeneration Reliance**: The Sentinel counts on regeneration to outlast enemies. Players must either destroy the core, remove it from the area (to stop regeneration), or use overwhelming burst damage.
- **Stone Shaping for Tactical Advantage**: It uses Legendary Actions to create walls that separate the party or collapse obstacles onto enemies.

#### Loot
- Pillar stone shard (glows with residual power) - **Trade Value**: 80 supplies, can be used in rituals to stabilize magic or as a component for enchantments
- Guardian core (if extracted intact) - **Trade Value**: 150 supplies, extremely rare, can be studied to learn ancient construct-building techniques
- Sentinel armor plates (massive stone slabs) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies each (1d3 plates), can be carved into shields or walls
- Ancient glyphs (inscribed on the Sentinel's body) - **Trade Value**: Priceless for historians, can be copied for lore

#### Scaling Options
**Awakened Pillar Sentinel** (Legendary, TV 6+): +50 HP, increase Fury to 7, Pillar Magic to 5. Add "Pillar Resonance" ability (the Sentinel can teleport to any Pillar site within 1 mile as an action once per day). Increase Legendary Actions to 4 per round. Add "Summon Stone Guardians" Legendary Action (costs 3 actions, summons 1d3 Spellbound Golems to assist).

---

### 3. Spellbound Golem

**Type**: Construct (Magical Servant)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 3-7

#### Lore
Spellbound Golems are the workhorses of arcane workshops and sorcerer towers. They're created by binding elemental spirits into clay, stone, or metal bodies. These golems follow simple commands and perform tasks too dangerous or tedious for mortals.

Most golems are obedient and harmless—unless their master is threatened. When activated for combat, they're surprisingly effective, using their elemental nature to adapt to different threats.

Golems are common in ancient ruins, left behind by long-dead mages. They'll attack intruders unless given a command word (which few know) or convinced they're authorized visitors.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 30
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 3
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (Physical saves), 1 (Magical saves), 0 (Mental, immune)
- **Movement**: 4 tiles per turn (slow and lumbering)
- **Armor**: Medium (stone/clay body, Armor 3 vs Physical, Armor 1 vs Elemental)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 2
- Shadow: 1
- Will: 0
- Focus: 2
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Brawling: 3
- Elemental Affinity: 2
- Labor: 3

#### Attacks
**Stone Fist** (Fury 3 + Brawling 3 = 6d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical damage
- Effect: The Golem can make two Stone Fist attacks per turn (multi-attack).

**Elemental Burst** (Soul 2 + Elemental Affinity 2 = 4d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 20-foot cone
- Damage: 5 Elemental damage (type depends on golem variant: Fire, Cold, Lightning, or Force)
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 2 Shadow save or suffer an additional status effect based on element:
  - **Fire**: Burning (2 Fire damage per turn for 2 turns)
  - **Cold**: Slowed (half movement for 2 turns)
  - **Lightning**: Shocked (Disadvantage on next attack)
  - **Force**: Pushed back 10 feet

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means (requires repair with Focus + Arcane Lore, DR 2, restores 10 HP).

**Elemental Body**: The Golem has resistance to one elemental damage type (Fire, Cold, Lightning, or Acid, chosen when created). It takes half damage from that type.

**Slow but Steady**: The Golem cannot be knocked Prone, Grappled, or moved against its will (too heavy and stable).

**Command Word Vulnerability**: If a character knows the Golem's command word (requires Arcane Lore or research), they can deactivate it with a DR 3 Focus + Arcane Lore roll. The Golem shuts down for 1 minute (or until reactivated).

**Mindless Obedience**: The Golem follows the last order it was given, even if centuries old. Clever players can convince it they're authorized by the "master" (requires Persuasion or Deception, DR 3).

#### Tactics
- **Simple Aggression**: Golems attack the nearest target with Stone Fist, using multi-attack to pummel one enemy.
- **Elemental Burst When Available**: They use Elemental Burst when it recharges, prioritizing clustered enemies.
- **Guard Specific Locations**: Golems typically guard doorways, treasures, or their master's workshop. They won't chase fleeing enemies beyond their assigned area.
- **No Strategy**: Golems don't retreat, flank, or coordinate. They execute orders and attack until destroyed.

#### Loot
- Elemental core (fist-sized gem, glows with elemental energy) - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies, can be used in enchanting or alchemy
- Clay/stone fragments (can be repurposed for crafting) - **Trade Value**: 5 supplies
- Command word scroll (if the golem's creator left records) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies, allows control of similar golems

#### Scaling Options
**Reinforced Golem** (Elite, TV 2): +15 HP, increase Fury to 4, DV to 4. Add "Crushing Grip" ability (Grapple attack, deals 4 automatic damage per turn to grappled target).

### 4. Iron-Cage Beast

**Type**: Construct (Hylden Bio-Construct)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 7-12

#### Lore
Iron-Cage Beasts are Hylden abominations—twisted fusions of living flesh and metal. The Hylden imprison tormented souls within iron frameworks, forcing them to serve as weapons of war. The result is a hybrid horror: part beast, part machine, part screaming ghost.

These constructs are fast, aggressive, and unpredictable. The trapped soul sometimes tries to fight the Hylden programming, causing erratic behavior. They're in constant agony, and that pain fuels their fury.

Iron-Cage Beasts are common in Hylden ruins and battlefields. They're often found in packs, coordinated by Hylden Warlords or Flesh Architects.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 42
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 6
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (Physical saves), 3 (Soul saves), 1 (Mental saves)
- **Movement**: 9 tiles per turn (very fast, quadruped)
- **Armor**: Medium (iron frame + tough hide, Armor 2 vs Physical, Armor 1 vs Soul)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 4
- Soul: 3
- Shadow: 4
- Will: 2
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 1

**Skills**:
- Savage Combat: 4
- Soul Resistance: 2
- Pack Coordination: 3

#### Attacks
**Clawed Iron Limbs** (Fury 4 + Savage Combat 4 = 8d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 7 Physical damage
- Effect: The Beast can make two Clawed Iron Limbs attacks per turn (multi-attack). On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Bleeding** (2 Physical damage per turn).

**Soul Scream** (Soul 3 + Anguish 3 = 6d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 30-foot cone
- Damage: 6 Soul damage to all creatures in the cone
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 3 Will save or be **Frightened** (Disadvantage on attacks, cannot willingly move closer to the Beast) for 2 rounds. This is the trapped soul's torment made manifest.

**Pounce** (Fury 4 + Pack Coordination 3 = 7d6, once per turn as a bonus action if the Beast moved at least 15 feet)
- Range: Charge attack
- Damage: 8 Physical damage
- Effect: Target must pass a DR 3 Fury save or be knocked **Prone**.

#### Abilities
**Hybrid Nature**: The Beast is part construct, part undead. It's immune to poison and disease, but vulnerable to both Radiant damage (harms the soul) and Lightning damage (disrupts the iron frame). Both deal +2 damage.

**Agonized Fury**: When the Beast is reduced below half HP, it enters a rage. It gains +2 dice on all attacks and movement speed increases by 3 tiles per turn. However, it can no longer use Soul Scream (the soul is too fragmented).

**Pack Tactics**: The Beast gains +1 die on attack rolls for each allied Iron-Cage Beast or Hylden creature within 10 feet (max +3 dice).

**Trapped Soul**: The soul within the Beast is suffering. Characters with Soul-based abilities (Wraiths, Soul Reavers, etc.) can attempt to free the soul with a DR 4 Soul + Rituals roll (requires 1 action in combat). If successful, the Beast collapses (instant death) and the soul is released (may provide information or gratitude).

**Erratic Behavior**: At the start of each of the Beast's turns, roll 1d6. On a 1, the trapped soul briefly resists, and the Beast skips its turn (stunned by internal conflict). This represents the soul fighting the Hylden programming.

#### Tactics
- **Fast and Aggressive**: Iron-Cage Beasts charge in with Pounce, knocking targets Prone, then follow up with Clawed Iron Limbs.
- **Soul Scream for Disruption**: They use Soul Scream to Frighten enemies, creating space for allies or preventing retaliation.
- **Pack Coordination**: They work with other Hylden creatures, using Pack Tactics to amplify attacks.
- **Agonized Fury Finish**: When wounded, they become even more dangerous, attacking relentlessly until destroyed.
- **Erratic Behavior Unpredictability**: The 1-in-6 chance of skipping a turn makes them unreliable but tragic—the soul is fighting back.

#### Loot
- Iron frame pieces (twisted metal, still humming with energy) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies, can be used in crafting or sold to engineers
- Soul shard (if the soul is freed or destroyed) - **Trade Value**: 25 supplies, used in soul-based rituals or alchemy
- Hylden bio-glyph (etched into the frame) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies, studied by scholars to understand Hylden techniques

#### Scaling Options
**Alpha Iron-Cage Beast** (Boss, TV 4): +25 HP, increase Fury to 5, Savage Combat to 5. Remove Erratic Behavior (the soul has been fully dominated). Add "Coordinated Assault" ability (once per turn, command all allied Beasts within 30 feet to make a free Pounce attack). Add 2 Legendary Actions per round: Move, Attack, or Soul Scream.

---

### 5. Glyphfused Automaton

**Type**: Construct (Arcane Guardian)  
**Threat Tier**: Elite (TV 2)  
**Recommended Levels**: 8-13

#### Lore
Glyphfused Automatons are advanced constructs created by the Circle of Nine before the Pillars fell. They're powered by living glyphs—magical symbols that regenerate and adapt to threats. These automatons served as bodyguards, assassins, and enforcers for the most powerful sorcerers.

Each Automaton is covered in shifting glyphs that change color and pattern based on their current function. Blue glyphs indicate defensive mode. Red glyphs signal combat. Black glyphs mean the Automaton is executing a termination protocol.

They're rare, found only in the deepest vaults and most secure ruins. Encountering one means the party has stumbled onto something important—and dangerous.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 55
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 7
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 3 (all saves), 0 (Mental, immune)
- **Movement**: 7 tiles per turn (agile)
- **Armor**: Medium (arcane plating, Armor 3 vs Physical, Armor 4 vs Magic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 3
- Soul: 5
- Shadow: 4
- Will: 0
- Focus: 5
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Precision Combat: 4
- Glyph Magic: 5
- Evasion: 3

#### Attacks
**Glyph Blade** (Fury 3 + Precision Combat 4 = 7d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 6 Physical + 3 Force damage
- Effect: The blade is wreathed in glyphs. It ignores Physical Armor (Force damage bypasses Physical Armor). The Automaton can make two Glyph Blade attacks per turn.

**Glyph Bolt** (Soul 5 + Glyph Magic 5 = 10d6, costs 2 SE)
- Range: 50 feet
- Damage: 8 Force damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Unraveled** (lose 2 SE or BP, or take 2 additional Soul damage if they have neither).

**Glyph Prison** (Soul 5 + Glyph Magic 5 = 10d6, Recharge 5-6, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Automaton targets one creature and attempts to trap them in a cage of glyphs. Target must pass a DR 4 Shadow save or be **Restrained** (cannot move, Disadvantage on attacks and Defense). The target can attempt to break free with a DR 4 Fury + Athletics or Focus + Arcane Lore roll at the start of each of their turns. The prison lasts up to 3 rounds.

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means (requires repair with Focus + Arcane Lore, DR 4, restores 15 HP).

**Glyph Adaptation**: At the start of each of the Automaton's turns, its glyphs shift. It gains resistance to the last damage type it took (half damage from that type until it shifts again). This makes it progressively harder to damage with repeated attacks.

**Arcane Deflection**: The Automaton has Advantage on saves vs spells and magical effects. When it successfully saves against a spell, it regains 2 SE.

**Phase Step**: As a bonus action, the Automaton can teleport up to 15 feet to any unoccupied space it can see (glyphs allow brief reality shifts). This can be used once per turn.

**Self-Repair Protocol**: When reduced below 20 HP, the Automaton spends 1 round repairing itself (cannot attack, gains +4 DV). At the end of the round, it regains 20 HP. This can only be used once per encounter.

#### Tactics
- **Glyph Bolt at Range**: Automatons open combat with Glyph Bolt, targeting casters or priority threats from afar.
- **Phase Step for Positioning**: They teleport around the battlefield, avoiding being surrounded and always keeping optimal range.
- **Glyph Prison for Control**: They use Glyph Prison to neutralize the biggest threat (usually the party's strongest fighter or caster), then focus on weaker targets.
- **Glyph Blade When Cornered**: If enemies close to melee, they use Glyph Blade's multi-attack and armor-bypassing damage to punish them.
- **Glyph Adaptation for Defense**: They tank repeated attacks from the same source, gaining resistance and becoming harder to kill.
- **Self-Repair When Bloodied**: They retreat with Phase Step and trigger Self-Repair Protocol, forcing enemies to break through their defenses again.

#### Loot
- Glyph core (pulsing with arcane energy) - **Trade Value**: 70 supplies, can be used to enchant items or learn advanced glyph magic
- Arcane plating (Armor 3 vs Physical, Armor 4 vs Magic) - **Trade Value**: 50 supplies, can be repurposed into armor
- Living glyph scroll (contains 1d3 glyphs that can be studied) - **Trade Value**: 40 supplies, teaches glyph spells or rituals

#### Scaling Options
**Master Glyphfused Automaton** (Boss, TV 4): +30 HP, increase Soul and Glyph Magic to 6. Add "Glyph Overload" ability (explodes in a 30-foot radius when destroyed, dealing 12 Force damage to all creatures, DR 4 Shadow save to halve). Add 3 Legendary Actions per round: Phase Step, Glyph Bolt, or Glyph Prison (costs 2 actions).

---

### 6. Hylden Soul-Tower

**Type**: Construct (Hylden Siege Engine)  
**Threat Tier**: Boss (TV 4)  
**Recommended Levels**: 12-17

#### Lore
Soul-Towers are massive Hylden war machines—walking fortresses powered by hundreds of imprisoned souls. They stand three stories tall, bristling with bio-mechanical weaponry and arcane cannons. Each step shakes the ground.

The Hylden used Soul-Towers to besiege cities and break fortress walls. They're virtually indestructible from conventional attacks, requiring coordinated strikes on weak points or the destruction of their soul cores.

Most Soul-Towers were destroyed or sealed after the Hylden were banished. Those that remain lie dormant in ancient battlefields, waiting for Hylden agents to reactivate them. When awakened, they're apocalyptic threats capable of razing entire settlements.

#### Stats

- Range: Melee (20-foot reach due to size)
- Damage: 15 Physical damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), target is **Grappled** (held by the Tower's massive claw). While Grappled, the target takes 8 automatic damage at the start of each of their turns. Escape requires a DR 5 Fury + Athletics roll.

**Soul Cannon** (Soul 6 + Soul Binding 5 = 11d6, costs 4 SE)
- Range: 80-foot line
- Damage: 14 Soul damage to all creatures in the line
- Effect: Targets must pass a DR 5 Will save or lose 3 SE (or take 3 additional Soul damage if they have no SE).

- Range: 60-foot radius centered on a point within 100 feet
- Damage: 12 Force damage to all creatures in the radius

**Colossal Size**: The Soul-Tower occupies a 4x4 tile space. It has 20-foot reach on melee attacks. Creatures can move through its space but treat it as difficult terrain.

**Soul-Powered Regeneration**: The Tower regains 15 HP at the start of each of its turns (fueled by trapped souls). This regeneration can only be stopped by destroying one of its three **Soul Cores** (see below).

**Soul Cores** (3 cores, each has DV 7, 40 HP): The Tower has three soul cores embedded in its body (chest, back, and head). Each core is a separate target that must be attacked individually (requires a called shot with Disadvantage). When a core is destroyed:
- The Tower loses 50 HP immediately (backlash).
- Soul-Powered Regeneration is reduced by 5 HP per turn.
- When all three cores are destroyed, the Tower's regeneration stops, and it loses its final 50 HP (collapsing).

**Siege Armor**: The Tower has Armor 6 vs Physical, Armor 4 vs Elemental, and Armor 2 vs Soul. Attacks with "Armor Piercing" reduce these by 3.

**Legendary Actions (4 per round)**: The Soul-Tower can use Legendary Actions at the end of another creature's turn. It has 4 Legendary Actions per round.

- **Soul-Powered Regeneration**: It relies on regeneration to outlast enemies. Players must destroy the cores to stop healing.
- **Repair Protocol for Sustain**: When wounded, it uses Legendary Actions to repair itself, forcing players to maintain pressure.
- **Protect Cores**: The Tower positions itself to make core attacks difficult (keeping them away from ranged attackers, using terrain for cover).

### 7. Bound-Logic Scribe

**Type**: Construct (Information Archive)  
**Threat Tier**: Standard (TV 1)  
**Recommended Levels**: 2-6

#### Lore
Bound-Logic Scribes are constructs designed for one purpose: preserving knowledge. They're found in ancient libraries, vaults, and research facilities, where they catalog, organize, and protect texts and artifacts.

These constructs resemble skeletal humanoids made of bronze and glass, with glowing runic symbols etched into their frames. They're not inherently hostile—unless someone tries to steal from the archives they guard.

Scribes are valuable sources of information. They can answer questions about their archive's contents, though they speak in formal, archaic language and require precise phrasing. They're also surprisingly dangerous when provoked, using their knowledge of combat techniques and anatomical weak points to fight intruders.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 28
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 2 (Physical saves), 3 (Magical saves), 0 (Mental, immune)
- **Movement**: 6 tiles per turn
- **Armor**: Light (bronze frame, Armor 2 vs Physical, Armor 3 vs Magic)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 3
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 0
- Focus: 5
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Knowledge (all subjects): 5
- Precision Combat: 3
- Archive Defense: 2

#### Attacks
**Scribe's Stylus** (Focus 5 + Precision Combat 3 = 8d6)
- Range: Melee
- Damage: 5 Physical damage
- Effect: On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the Scribe strikes a pressure point, causing the target to be **Stunned** until the end of their next turn (exploiting anatomical knowledge).

**Glyph Seal** (Soul 3 + Archive Defense 2 = 5d6, Recharge 5-6)
- Range: 20 feet
- Damage: None
- Effect: The Scribe inscribes a glyph in the air that binds one target. Target must pass a DR 3 Will save or be **Silenced** (cannot speak, cast spells with verbal components, or use abilities requiring speech) for 3 rounds.

**Knowledge Blast** (Focus 5 + Knowledge 5 = 10d6, once per encounter, costs 3 SE)
- Range: 30-foot cone
- Damage: 6 Soul damage
- Effect: The Scribe overwhelms targets with a telepathic torrent of information. Targets must pass a DR 3 Will save or be **Confused** (Disadvantage on all rolls for 2 rounds, as their minds reel from information overload).

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means (requires repair with Focus + Engineering or Arcane Lore, DR 2, restores 10 HP).

**Living Archive**: The Scribe has encyclopedic knowledge of its archive's contents. Players can ask it questions about history, magic, creatures, or lore. It answers truthfully but in precise, formal language. It will not answer questions unrelated to its archive.

**Defensive Protocol**: The Scribe will not attack unless someone attempts to steal from the archive, damage its contents, or harm the Scribe itself. Clever players can read and study the archive without triggering combat—but taking anything activates the Scribe.

**Precision Strikes**: The Scribe has studied combat techniques and anatomy for centuries. Its attacks target weak points, giving it Advantage on attack rolls vs creatures it has observed for at least 1 round (it's analyzing them).

**Fragile but Evasive**: The Scribe has low HP but high DV. It avoids being hit rather than tanking damage.

#### Tactics
- **Observe First**: The Scribe watches intruders for 1 round before acting, gaining Advantage on attacks vs them (studying weaknesses).
- **Glyph Seal for Casters**: It uses Glyph Seal to Silence spellcasters, neutralizing their most dangerous abilities.
- **Precision Strikes**: It uses Scribe's Stylus to Stun priority targets (usually the strongest fighter), then focuses on others.
- **Knowledge Blast for Groups**: If surrounded, it uses Knowledge Blast to Confuse everyone, creating chaos.
- **Retreat to Archive**: If reduced below 10 HP, the Scribe retreats deeper into the archive, where it may have reinforcements (other Scribes or traps).

#### Loot
- Bronze stylus (weapon, can be used as a dagger +1) - **Trade Value**: 10 supplies
- Knowledge crystal (contains a copy of one random text from the archive) - **Trade Value**: 30 supplies, can be read to learn lore or spells
- Archive access token (allows safe passage through the archive) - **Trade Value**: 20 supplies (or story leverage)

#### Scaling Options
**Master Scribe** (Elite, TV 2): +15 HP, increase Focus and Knowledge to 6. Add "Summon Lesser Scribes" ability (once per encounter, summons 1d3 Minion-tier Scribes to assist). Increase Knowledge Blast damage to 8 Soul damage.

### 8. Obsidian Drone

**Type**: Construct (Hylden Scout)  
**Threat Tier**: Minion (TV 0.25)  
**Recommended Levels**: 1-4

#### Lore
Obsidian Drones are small, flying constructs created by the Hylden for reconnaissance and harassment. They're about the size of a human head, made of polished obsidian with glowing red eyes. They patrol Hylden ruins, reporting intruders to their masters.

Individually, they're weak. In swarms, they're deadly. They use hit-and-run tactics, swooping in to attack and then flying out of reach.

Drones are often the first encounter players have with Hylden technology. Their presence indicates Hylden activity nearby—and worse threats to come.

#### Stats
- **HP**: 10
- **Defense Value (DV)**: 5 (small and fast)
- **Difficulty Rating (DR)**: 1 (Physical saves), 0 (Mental, immune)
- **Movement**: 4 tiles per turn (ground), 10 tiles per turn (flying)
- **Armor**: None (obsidian shell, but no mitigation)

**Attributes**:
- Fury: 2
- Soul: 1
- Shadow: 3
- Will: 0
- Focus: 3
- Blood: 0

**Skills**:
- Evasion: 3
- Surveillance: 2

#### Attacks
**Obsidian Shard** (Focus 3 + Ranged Combat 2 = 5d6)
- Range: 30 feet
- Damage: 3 Physical damage
- Effect: The Drone fires a shard of obsidian. On Critical Hit (3+ successes), the target is **Bleeding** (1 Physical damage per turn).

**Divebomb** (Fury 2 + Melee 1 = 3d6, once per turn if the Drone flew at least 10 feet)
- Range: Melee (charge attack)
- Damage: 4 Physical damage
- Effect: The Drone slams into a target and immediately flies away (no opportunity attack). If multiple Drones coordinate, they can all Divebomb the same target on the same turn.

#### Abilities
**Construct Nature**: Immune to fear, charm, corruption, poison, disease, and mental effects. Does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Cannot be healed by normal means (requires repair with Focus + Hylden Engineering, DR 2, restores 5 HP).

**Flight**: The Drone can fly, ignoring ground-based obstacles and terrain. While flying, melee attackers have Disadvantage unless they can reach the Drone.

**Swarm Tactics**: Drones always appear in groups of 4-8. They coordinate attacks, focusing on one target at a time. Each Drone within 10 feet of an ally gains +1 die on attack rolls (max +3 dice).

**Surveillance Relay**: Drones transmit everything they see to their Hylden masters. If a Drone escapes, nearby Hylden forces will be alerted (GM determines response time and reinforcements).

**Fragile**: Drones have low HP. They're designed to harass, not endure. A single solid hit usually destroys them.

#### Tactics
- **Swarm Harassment**: Drones fly in circles around the party, firing Obsidian Shards and using Divebomb attacks.
- **Focus Fire**: They all attack the same target (usually the weakest or most isolated PC), using Swarm Tactics to maximize damage.
- **Stay Out of Reach**: They remain airborne, forcing ranged attacks or spells. Melee characters must find ways to ground them.
- **Retreat and Report**: If more than half the swarm is destroyed, the survivors flee to report to their masters.

#### Loot
- Obsidian shards (1d3 shards, sharp and valuable) - **Trade Value**: 3 supplies each, can be used as daggers or sold
- Hylden surveillance core (small gem, records recent events) - **Trade Value**: 15 supplies, can be reviewed to see what the Drone witnessed

#### Scaling Options
**Enhanced Drone** (Standard, TV 1): +8 HP, increase Focus to 4. Add "Explosive Death" ability (when destroyed, explodes in 10-foot radius, dealing 4 Fire damage to all creatures, DR 2 Shadow save to halve).

## Combat Tactics & Encounter Design

### Using Constructs Effectively

**Environmental Context**: Constructs are found in specific locations—ruins, vaults, workshops, battlefields. Their presence tells a story: who built them, why, and what they're guarding.

**Programming Exploits**: Constructs follow rules. Clever players can exploit loopholes:
- "You guard this door" → "What if we go through the wall?"
- "Attack intruders" → "We're not intruders, we're guests!"
- Command words, access tokens, and disguises can bypass constructs entirely.

**Weakness Exploitation**: Constructs have predictable vulnerabilities:
- Lightning disrupts magical cores
- Acid corrodes frames
- Destroying power sources (cores, glyphs) shuts them down instantly

**Lack of Morale**: Constructs never flee, never surrender, never negotiate (unless programmed to). This makes them straightforward combat encounters but also relentless.

### Sample Encounters

#### Encounter 1: The Vault Guardians (Levels 5-7)
**Setup**: The party enters an ancient vault. 2 **Clockwork Knights** (Elite, TV 2 each, TV 4 total) activate and block the path. Behind them, 4 **Obsidian Drones** (Minions, TV 0.25 each, TV 1 total) swarm the party. Total TV: 5.

**Tactics**: Knights form a shield wall, using Formation Protocol and Holy Ward to protect each other. Drones fly overhead, harassing with Obsidian Shards. Knights attack any vampire PCs first (Anti-Vampire Directive).

**Environmental Factor**: The vault has narrow corridors. Knights block the path, forcing PCs to either destroy them or find alternate routes (climbing over, squeezing past, breaking walls).

**Twist**: If the party presents a Sarafan insignia or speaks a holy prayer, the Knights may recognize them as "authorized" and allow passage (DR 3 Persuasion or Deception).

---

#### Encounter 2: The Pillar's Wrath (Levels 10-12)
**Setup**: The party approaches a collapsed Pillar. A **Pillar-Guardian Sentinel** (Boss, TV 4) awakens, believing them to be defilers. It's accompanied by 2 **Spellbound Golems** (Standard, TV 1 each, TV 2 total). Total TV: 6.

**Tactics**: The Sentinel opens with Pillar Beam to Stun priority targets, then uses Stone Spike Eruption to create difficult terrain. Golems guard the Sentinel's flanks, attacking anyone who gets close. The Sentinel uses Legendary Actions to reshape the battlefield with Stone Shaping, creating walls and obstacles.

**Environmental Factor**: The Pillar site is sacred ground. Corrupted PCs or those wielding forbidden magic may trigger additional hostility (Sentinel gains +2 dice on attacks vs them).

**Twist**: If the party can convince the Sentinel they're trying to *restore* the Pillar (not destroy it), it may stand down (requires DR 4 Persuasion + Pillar Lore, and proof of good intentions).

---

#### Encounter 3: The Hylden War Machine (Levels 12-15)
**Setup**: Hylden forces have reactivated a **Soul-Tower** (Boss, TV 4) and are marching it toward a village. The party must stop it before it arrives. The Tower is escorted by 3 **Iron-Cage Beasts** (Elite, TV 2 each, TV 6 total). Total TV: 10.

**Tactics**: The Tower advances slowly, using Arcane Bombardment to bombard the village while Beasts defend it from melee attackers. The Tower uses Crushing Limb to Grapple anyone who gets close, while Beasts use Soul Scream to Frighten defenders. The Tower uses Legendary Actions to Repair itself and fire Soul Cannon continuously.

**Environmental Factor**: The battlefield is open (flat plains). PCs must either attack the Tower directly (focusing on Soul Cores) or sabotage it (climb onto it, disable cores, jam machinery with DR 4 Focus + Engineering rolls).

**Twist**: If the party frees the trapped souls from the Tower (by destroying cores and performing a DR 5 Soul + Rituals ritual), the souls may turn on the Tower from within, dealing massive internal damage (50 HP) and weakening its defenses.

---

#### Encounter 4: The Archive Defense (Levels 4-6)
**Setup**: The party needs information from an ancient library. A **Bound-Logic Scribe** (Standard, TV 1) guards the archive. It allows them to read but attacks if they try to take anything. It's assisted by 4 **Glyphfused Automatons** (Minions, scaled-down versions, TV 0.25 each, TV 1 total). Total TV: 2.

**Tactics**: The Scribe watches the party, using Precision Strikes to Stun anyone reaching for books. Automatons patrol the archive, using Phase Step to intercept thieves. The Scribe uses Glyph Seal to Silence casters, preventing magical theft.

**Environmental Factor**: The archive is filled with flammable texts. Using Fire damage risks destroying valuable knowledge (and angering the Scribe further).

**Twist**: The Scribe can be bargained with. If the party offers to repair the archive (restore damaged texts, return stolen books from elsewhere), it may allow them to copy (not take) one text as payment.

## Integrating Constructs into Your Campaign

### Constructs as Dungeon Guardians
Use constructs to guard important locations:
- **Vaults**: Clockwork Knights and Spellbound Golems
- **Pillar Sites**: Pillar-Guardian Sentinels
- **Libraries**: Bound-Logic Scribes
- **Hylden Ruins**: Iron-Cage Beasts and Obsidian Drones

Constructs make dungeons feel alive (even though they're not). They force players to think tactically, exploit weaknesses, or find non-combat solutions.

### Constructs as Plot Devices
Constructs can reveal lore:
- **Bound-Logic Scribes** answer questions about ancient history
- **Obsidian Drones** record events, which can be reviewed
- **Pillar-Guardian Sentinels** guard artifacts needed for quests

They're also tools for villains. A Hylden Warlock activating a Soul-Tower creates an apocalyptic threat that drives the plot forward.

### Constructs and Morality
Unlike mortals or beasts, destroying constructs is morally simple—they're machines. However, some constructs blur the line:
- **Iron-Cage Beasts** contain trapped, suffering souls. Is destroying them mercy or murder?
- **Bound-Logic Scribes** preserve knowledge. Destroying them may erase irreplaceable history.

Use these moral complexities to create dilemmas.

### Construct Weaknesses
Reward clever players who exploit weaknesses:
- Lightning damage to disrupt cores
- Command words to deactivate them
- Hacking/reprogramming with Focus + Engineering or Arcane Lore
- Destroying power sources (cores, glyphs) for instant kills

Constructs should feel powerful but not invincible.

---

## Story Hooks

### The Vault of the First Circle
A **Pillar-Guardian Sentinel** guards a vault containing artifacts from before the Pillars fell. The party needs one artifact to stop a greater threat. Can they negotiate with the Sentinel, or must they destroy it—and risk losing the knowledge it protects?

### The Soul-Tower Awakens
Hylden agents have reactivated a **Soul-Tower** buried beneath a city. It's drilling upward, and when it breaches the surface, it will level everything above. The party has 72 hours to infiltrate the ruins, reach the Tower, and destroy its cores before it emerges.

### The Library of Whispers
An ancient library holds the answer to breaking a curse. But a **Bound-Logic Scribe** guards it, and it will only share knowledge with those who can answer its riddles. If the party fails, it attacks—and the library's traps activate.

### The Clockwork Crusade
A rogue **Clockwork Knight** has gone berserk, its Anti-Vampire Directive corrupted to "kill all living things." It's leading a squad of malfunctioning constructs through the countryside. The party must stop it before it reaches a populated area—but they need its intact core to repair their own defenses.

### The Freed Souls
The party destroys an **Iron-Cage Beast**, freeing the trapped soul. The grateful spirit offers to guide them to a Hylden weapons cache—but warns that more Beasts guard it. The party must decide: risk another encounter for powerful loot, or move on?

---

## GM Guidance: Running Construct Encounters

### Make Them Feel Mechanical
Constructs move and fight with precision. Describe them as:
- "The Clockwork Knight's joints click and whir as it raises its sword."
- "The Sentinel's eyes glow brighter as it targets you with cold, mechanical focus."
- "The Drone's movements are jerky and unnatural, like a puppet on strings."

This reinforces their artificial nature and contrasts with organic enemies.

### Use Environment
Constructs don't just fight—they *activate* within environments. Describe:
- Pressure plates triggering golems
- Drones emerging from wall panels
- Sentinels rising from the ground

This makes dungeons feel interactive and dangerous.

### Reward Creativity
Players who think outside the box should succeed:
- Hacking constructs with engineering
- Using command words to deactivate them
- Exploiting programming loopholes
- Destroying power sources for instant kills

Constructs should be puzzles as much as combat encounters.

### Balance Lethality
Constructs are dangerous but predictable. They hit hard but follow patterns. Players who observe and adapt should be able to overcome them.

### Connect to Lore
Every construct tells a story. Who built it? Why? What does its presence reveal about this location? Use constructs to hint at larger mysteries.
